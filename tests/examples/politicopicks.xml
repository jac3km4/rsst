<br>
<p>The yearslong push for over-the-counter birth control is taking on fresh urgency in the wake of a potential Supreme Court decision rolling back abortion rights.</p>
<p>HRA Pharma and Cadence Health have worked with the FDA for the past six years to ensure studies of their pills can pass muster with an agency that has always required people to get a prescription for oral contraceptives.</p>
<p>The culmination of this work comes amid concerns that overturning <i>Roe </i>could disproportionately affect low-income people, as well as younger adults and people of color — the groups that could most benefit from over-the-counter contraception.<b> </b>HRA Pharma expects to seek over-the-counter status for its drug, Hana, later this year, though Cadence is still a couple years away.</p>
<p>“Access to the pill over the counter really is an equity issue, and now more than ever we need to be doing everything in our power to break down barriers to contraception, knowing that access to abortion is going to become much harder in this nation," said Raegan McDonald-Mosley, CEO of Power to Decide, a nonprofit that works to prevent unplanned pregnancies.<br></p>
<br>
<p>The prospect of having a daily birth control pill available anywhere people can purchase medicines without a doctor’s supervision comes nearly two decades after a bruising battle at FDA over making the emergency contraception drug known as “Plan B” available over the counter — a political row that prompted the resignation of Susan Wood, the agency’s director of the Office of Women’s Health.</p>
<p>“The reviewers and the leadership get pressures from all directions, so it’s really important that any kind of protection around FDA is in place and it is maintained and strengthened because it’s not perfect,” said Wood, now a health policy professor at George Washington University.</p>
<p>Democratic lawmakers are pressuring the FDA to move quickly once the applications are submitted. “The health and well-being of people capable of pregnancy across America is at stake,” 59 House members led by the chairs of the Pro-Choice Caucus wrote FDA Commissioner Robert Califf in March.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some conservative lawmakers are working to restrict access to contraception, and<b> </b>Sen. <a href="https://cd.politicopro.com/member/51279" data-person-id="51279" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3272-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff7cad0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1651706114277,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-2ca1-db91-affd-fdb9430a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1651706114277,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-2ca1-db91-affd-fdb9430a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;member&quot;:&quot;{\&quot;identifier\&quot;:\&quot;51279\&quot;,\&quot;url\&quot;:\&quot;https://cd.politicopro.com/member/51279\&quot;,\&quot;preferredName\&quot;:\&quot;Sen.

The Oral Contraceptives Over-the-Counter Working Group, which counts Wood as a member, began working with HRA Pharma in 2016 to conduct research to help support an application for an OTC designation.</p>
<p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Family Physicians have backed over-the-counter birth control pill options, which OTC advocates say makes it clear that FDA can and should endorse the switch.</p>
<p>“I don’t think that we would have embarked on this if that weren’t the case, and that should influence FDA to support it,” said<b> </b>Samantha Miller, co-CEO of Cadence Health.</p>
<p>Birth control pills, while overwhelmingly safe, can complicate some underlying health conditions and have always required a doctor's supervision.</p>
<p>Some advocates say it’ll likely be easier to make HRA's over-the-counter because it poses fewer risks to different groups of people. Hana is a progestin-only pill, which means there is less likelihood of adverse reactions. Cadence makes a combination pill that contains a mix of estrogen and a progestin. People over 35 years old, smokers or those who have poorly controlled high blood pressure or blood-clotting disorders may be advised to avoid combination pills.</p>
<p>Both companies must also ensure consumers can understand the label and follow directions accompanying the medication.<br></p>
<br>
<p>A spokesperson for HRA Pharma declined to comment on the FDA process but said the company strives to meet women's unmet medical needs.</p>
<p>“Expanding access to contraception and birth control options is an important part of healthcare," the company said in a statement. "A safe and effective over the counter birth control pill would improve access and decrease some of the barriers that people face getting contraception."</p>
<p>Miller said FDA has placed a clinical hold on actual use trials of Cadence’s combination pill, adding more requirements around monitoring trial participants’ blood pressure. The new requirements, which compelled Cadence to update its label and redo comprehension studies, have set back the company’s actual use trial by at least a year, she said.</p>
<p>“We are really committed to seeing this through all the way to the end,” Miller told POLITICO.</p>
<p>Advocates also are promoting an OTC designation for the pills without limiting their use to adults. They argue the science shows oral contraceptives are safe and effective in teens, and any foray into age restrictions would amount to politicizing the OTC switch.</p>
<p>“I’d be far more worried about [people over 80] taking something that might cause them injury than the under-15 crowd taking a drug that you cannot overdose on, that has no adverse events of any kind of note at all,” Wood said.</p>
<p>OTC birth control proponents say removing barriers to oral contraceptives is not a substitute for safe abortions but provides one more tool for people to prevent unintended pregnancies.</p>
<p>"Everyone should have the freedom to determine their own life path," said Victoria Nichols, project director for the Free the Pill campaign, which is associated with the OTC working group on the pill. "Both contraception and abortion are part of the full range of sexual and reproductive health care that allows us to exercise that freedom.”</p>

<p>If the Supreme Court overturns <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, as a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;draft opinion&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd223c0007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd223c0008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">draft opinion</a> suggests it will do, the impact on American law will have repercussions beyond Washington or the states set to ban most abortions.</p>
<p>Some conservatives see the <i>Roe</i> opinion as a simple matter of returning the abortion issue to the states, and Justice Samuel Alito’s draft suggests he sees it the same way: “The Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each State from regulating or prohibiting abortion,” he concludes. “<i>Roe</i> and <i>Casey</i> arrogated that authority. We now overrule those decisions and return that authority to the people and their elected representatives.”</p>
<p>But it’s not that simple.</p>
<p>Our research demonstrates that a post-<i>Roe</i> landscape is far more complicated than most Americans appreciate. Overturning <i>Roe </i>won’t simply kick the matter back to state governments. It will trigger new kinds of battles — among the states, and between states and the federal government — that will strain our federalist system.</p>
<p>If the Court overturns <i>Roe</i>, as the draft opinion indicates will happen, each state will be allowed to set its own abortion policy — banning it entirely or protecting it aggressively. <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2021/10/26-states-are-certain-or-likely-ban-abortion-without-roe-heres-which-ones-and-why" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;That means roughly half the country will ban abortion and half the country will not.&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2021/10/26-states-are-certain-or-likely-ban-abortion-without-roe-heres-which-ones-and-why&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd223c0009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd223c000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">That means roughly half the country will ban abortion and half the country will not.</a><br></p>
<br>
<p>But it won’t end there. The anti-abortion movement’s ultimate goal is to end abortion nationwide. To that end, some anti-abortion legislators and prosecutors will try to legislate beyond their borders to chill abortion everywhere. In response, abortion rights legislators will attempt to make their states abortion havens.</p>
<p>Here are just a few of the unsettled questions coming down the pike that show the myriad uncertainties of a post-<i>Roe</i> country.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">Can a state’s anti-abortion laws apply beyond its borders?</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/05/02/abortion-ban-roe-supreme-court-mississippi/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;The end goal of the anti-abortion movement is to ban abortion nationwide&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/05/02/abortion-ban-roe-supreme-court-mississippi/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd223c000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd223c000c&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">The end goal of the anti-abortion movement is to ban abortion nationwide</a>. While it waits to have the votes necessary to pass such a federal law, anti-abortion legislators, prosecutors and advocates may attempt to use other state tools to stop as many abortions as possible, reaching outside state borders to limit travel or punish out-of-state providers who provide abortion for their citizens.</p>
<p>Missouri already has given us a taste of what this will look like. Earlier this year, a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/08/missouri-abortion-ban-texas-supreme-court/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1651705857124,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-1f7f-d00d-a3c6-bf7f17e20001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1651705857124,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-1f7f-d00d-a3c6-bf7f17e20001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/08/missouri-abortion-ban-texas-supreme-court/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-9157-d7d2-adbc-ff5735680001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Missouri legislator introduced an amendment&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-9157-d7d2-adbc-ff5735680000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Missouri legislator introduced an amendment</a> that would create civil liability for anyone who helps another person travel out of state to get an abortion. While this bill did not become law, it is a clear signal that anti-abortion legislators are already thinking about this next frontier.<br>If they do move in this direction, they will be acting against basic principles of how Americans think about travel and law. Most of us assume that if we travel out of state, we must follow the laws of wherever we are and that the laws of our home state do not apply. Think of gambling in Las Vegas before it was widely legal elsewhere — people traveled there without even a thought that their home state, where gambling was illegal, would punish them when they returned from Nevada.</p>
<p>However, there is no settled law that clearly reflects this understanding. Though there are strong arguments that various parts of the Constitution — including the Due Process Clause, the Privileges or Immunities Clause, the Citizenship Clause and the Dormant Commerce Clause — prohibit states from exercising their jurisdiction beyond their borders, the precedent on these points is not well developed. This lack of precedent is easily manipulable by anti-abortion judges and justices to uphold state efforts to limit abortion travel or prosecute out-of-state providers. After all, few people believed that SB8, the Texas law that creates civil liability for providers offering abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, would be upheld, but the current Supreme Court did just that.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">Can liberal states provide abortion care for people from out of state?</h3>
<p>As abortion restrictions tighten, states with abortion rights legislators are already acting to help out-of-state people seeking abortions. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/30/connecticut-abortion-rights/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1651706091331,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-1f7f-d00d-a3c6-bf7f17e20001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1651706091331,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-1f7f-d00d-a3c6-bf7f17e20001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/30/connecticut-abortion-rights/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-915a-d337-a9cc-bbdac93b0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Connecticut is leading the way&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-915a-d337-a9cc-bbdac93b0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Connecticut is leading the way</a>, passing a bill that awaits the governor’s signature that will make the state a safe place for providers to care for people from other states.

<p>These laws are creative ways to protect abortion access. However, even these bills’ most ardent supporters recognize that they undermine some of the key principles of our federalist structure. States normally cooperate out of respect for one another. These abortion-supportive bills test this basic principle of interstate comity. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/13/opinion/missouri-abortion-roe-v-wade.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;We have advocated&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/13/opinion/missouri-abortion-roe-v-wade.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd223d0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd223d0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">We have advocated</a> elsewhere about the importance of such laws, but we can’t fail to recognize that these laws would chip away at a key facet of our national structure. These interstate conflicts could also wind up before the Supreme Court, where basic constitutional issues around national citizenship and state sovereignty will be at stake.<br></p>
<br>
<h3 style="text-align: left">What about abortion by mail?</h3>
<p>Historically, states have controlled abortion by controlling the providers who performed abortion procedures. But <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/evidence-you-can-use/medication-abortion" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;medication abortion&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.guttmacher.org/evidence-you-can-use/medication-abortion&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd223d0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd223d0006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">medication abortion</a> — the two-drug regimen that the FDA has approved to end a pregnancy in the first 10 weeks — is now available by mail. People who live in a state where abortion is illegal can buy abortion pills online, either on their own or with the help of international providers. And patients have found ways to obtain abortion pills via telehealth even when they live in states that forbid the practice by using mail forwarding or giving the address of a friend or family member who can forward the medication to them.</p>
<p>This exposes patients, particularly the most vulnerable patients, to various legal risks. But with state and local officials having no ability to tell what a package contains (and no legal authority to inspect packages without specific suspicion and a warrant), mailed pills will be difficult to police. Anti-abortion states understand that the changing landscape of early abortion care threatens to undermine abortion bans. To that end, states are increasingly passing bans on telehealth for abortion and banning distribution of the drugs within the state. Nevertheless, the practical reality is that some of those laws are going to be very difficult to enforce.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">What role can the federal government play post-Roe?</h3>
<p>Federal law is supreme over state law, so when state laws conflict with federal law, federal law prevails. There are a variety of federal laws and regulations, including those that govern its regulation of medication abortion through the FDA, as well as medical emergencies that might conflict with state abortion laws and poke holes in a state’s ability to ban abortion. For instance, advocates might argue that <a href="https://time.com/6141517/abortion-federal-law-preemption-roe-v-wade/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;the FDA’s approval and regulation of medication abortion could invalidate a state’s attempt to ban it&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://time.com/6141517/abortion-federal-law-preemption-roe-v-wade/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd223d0007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd223d0009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">the FDA’s approval and regulation of medication abortion could invalidate a state’s attempt to ban it</a> or that the federal law requiring hospitals to treat medical emergencies prohibits states from denying medically-necessary abortion care to patients.</p>
<p>The government could, conceivably, try to use its power over federal land to permit abortions in anti-abortion states, although there are limits to this power. If the federal government were to lease property to an abortion provider, for instance, there are legal arguments that state abortion laws might not apply to abortions on the federal land. These arguments rely on the basic principle that the federal government controls the laws on federal lands — and, as yet, there are no specific federal laws banning abortion. To be clear, there is no movement behind this idea yet, but this is one way the Biden administration could work around the policies of anti-abortion states. Once again, how the Supreme Court rules on such a move would be hard to predict.</p>
<p>The interstate and interjurisdictional conflicts on the horizon will test fundamental assumptions about the reach of state and federal power. If <i>Roe</i> is overturned, as is looking very likely, the draft opinion’s approach of returning this issue to the states could create more interjurisdictional battles than ever before, which is likely to only intensify the political conflict over abortion rights.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<br>
<p>ALLENTOWN, Pa. — The day after the Supreme Court’s draft majority opinion striking down <i>Roe v. Wade</i> rattled the nation, Carmen Bell and Lori McFarland weren't sure whom to blame.</p>
<p>The two Democratic women left a raucous Tuesday abortion-rights rally in the downtown of this rapidly diversifying Pennsylvania city rattling off their perceived culprits: GOP gerrymandering, Mitch McConnell and “dumb-dumb," Bell’s nickname for Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The duo was certain of this: their party’s desperate need to drive up turnout in November to prevent the draft opinion’s vision for abortion access from becoming reality in America.</p>
<p>“Women of our generation know what it was like when that wasn’t available,” said an exasperated Bell. She mused that the draft opinion threatening Roe “might be the catalyst.”</p>
<br><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6305657630112" frameborder="0"></iframe> 
<br>
<p><br>But this district hosts one of the most competitive House races in the nation, for the seat now held by Rep. Susan Wild (D-Pa.). And in her race as well as others, it’s far from clear that voters like Bell and McFarland can help their party harness its visceral anger with the conservative Supreme Court to energize its midterms drive.</p>
<p>The Tuesday rally suggested that Democrats’ base is starting to recover the kind of sign-waving protest energy that it hasn’t felt since Trump left office. What the party hasn’t gained yet is confidence in how to talk about the high court’s possible dismantling of abortion rights.</p>
<p>“I’m trying really hard not to make this about whether this will help us win in November, because it’s so important an issue that it transcends the election,” Wild said in an interview. But, she said: “People are pissed.”<br></p>

They’ve talked midterm message, their ad strategy, and which GOP incumbents to target.</p>
<p>Their most vulnerable Democrats haven’t been waiting for direction. Pink-hued protests outside courthouses, clinics and statehouses have popped up on short notice, headlined by incumbents like Reps. Chris Pappas (D-N.H.), Mikie Sherrill (D-N.J.) and Susie Lee (D-Nev.). Many have already begun <a href="https://twitter.com/SpanbergerVA07/status/1521824944308510721" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;calling for&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/SpanbergerVA07/status/1521824944308510721&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22410005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22410006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">calling for</a> more campaign volunteers this fall, while fundraising pleas have come from both swing and safe blue districts, spanning Georgia to New York to California.</p>
<p>“Republicans are going to be in a very tough place right now. They have to defend something that Republicans said would never happen,” said now-Sen. Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), who ran the House Democratic campaign arm during its 2018 takeover. “I think this is a very bad issue for them."</p>
<p>Luján and others helped translate suburban, anti-Trump anger that year into a Democratic wave, including in Pennsylvania where the party — with help from Wild — flipped multiple seats.</p>
<p>Alluding to that robust 2018 turnout, Luján suggested that the current building fury from women voters over <i>Roe</i> could play a similar role: “Republicans, they didn’t learn from past elections when women showed up."</p>
<p>Turnout was already a worry for Democrats this cycle. They noted warning signs in statewide contests like Virginia's last year, where Republicans showed up in dramatically higher numbers than expected. That’s particularly true in Pennsylvania this fall, with critical House seats, an open Senate seat and a governor’s race all expected to be competitive.</p>
<p>That effort to drive out voters here has now been put into overdrive. The winner of the governor’s race <a href="https://www.pennlive.com/nation-world/2022/05/what-happens-if-roe-v-wade-is-overturned-in-pa-the-answer-depends-on-the-november-governors-race.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;will determine&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.pennlive.com/nation-world/2022/05/what-happens-if-roe-v-wade-is-overturned-in-pa-the-answer-depends-on-the-november-governors-race.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22410007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22410008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">will determine</a> whether Pennsylvanians will eventually have their own abortion ban. The state's congressional seats could be crucial to whether national Democrats can act on abortion access after the high court's final ruling, expected next month.<br></p>
<br><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6305622329112" frameborder="0"></iframe> 
<br>
<p>And local Democrats here aren’t going to let their voters forget it. Speaking to a worked-up crowd in Allentown on Tuesday evening, the top Democrat in Pennsylvania's statehouse delivered a stern reminder to supporters.</p>
<p>“Someone asked me this morning, what’s your plan? I said my plan is Tuesday, November the eighth!” state Rep. Joanna McClinton roared as she addressed the rally. Behind her, the group — which included one gray-haired woman waving a metal coat hanger — broke into a cheer of “Vote blue in 2022.”</p>
<p>Another middle-aged woman held a sign that read “Do rapists have parental rights?”, while an older man wore a shirt featuring characters from the dystopian TV show "Handmaid’s Tale."</p>
<p>That sort of surge in enthusiasm, Democrats acknowledge behind closed doors, was sorely needed. Even with full control of Washington, the party remains paralyzed by its slim congressional margins and ongoing policy disputes between its left and centrist flanks. </p>
<p>In recent weeks, Democrats have also gotten swamped by a painful debate over border politics rather than talking about tackling inflation or jump-starting the economy, as many party members would prefer.</p>
<p>Abortion, however, isn’t like Biden’s campaign promises to deliver on child care, education or lowering health care costs. When it comes to <i>Roe</i>, Democrats say they have a chance to make the midterms about what they can protect their voters against — not just the legislative burden of creating new programs.</p>
<p>Deb Martin, another middle-aged Allentown Democrat who volunteers on get-out-the-vote efforts, hopes fear is a more powerful motivator.</p>
<p>“Maybe this is the thing we need. Because I feel like, leading up to the midterm election, the mood has been kind of subdued,” Martin said, noting that grassroots work has been “frustrating” lately. “It’s just a heavy lift.”<br></p>
<br>

<br>
<p>Democrats point to years of polling that shows most Americans believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases. That includes a slight majority of independent voters — a faction that will be critical in Wild’s reelection bid in her newly redrawn eastern Pennsylvania district.</p>
<p>Her seat became slightly redder overall after redistricting. Voters in her new district would have split nearly evenly between Trump and Biden in the 2020 election. But it also now includes <a href="https://www.mcall.com/news/elections/mc-nws-pa-redistricting-7th-district-makeup-20220225-cnt2j7uh2vfozamize7xyk5fqu-story.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1651704253734,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000159-dc3f-d10a-abf9-ddff8bcd0015&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1651704253734,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000159-dc3f-d10a-abf9-ddff8bcd0015&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.mcall.com/news/elections/mc-nws-pa-redistricting-7th-district-makeup-20220225-cnt2j7uh2vfozamize7xyk5fqu-story.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-913e-d337-a9cc-bbbec4500000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;many more people&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-913e-d337-a9cc-bbbec44f0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">many more people</a> who don’t register with either party.</p>
<p>“In a state like Pennsylvania, particularly this district, the independent vote matters tremendously,” Wild said. “I think this very well might be a deciding factor for the independent vote.”</p>
<p>Wild doesn’t yet know who she’ll be running against in November, with the state’s primary still two weeks away, but it is widely expected to be GOP business owner Lisa Scheller. The Republican came within 4 percentage points of beating Wild in 2020.</p>
<p>Scheller, whose team did not respond to requests for comment, said in a previous GOP debate that she would not support abortions in cases of rape or incest. Her opponent, veteran and business owner Kevin Dellicker, was in favor of banning all abortions.</p>
<p>“I support pro-life policies and I would never vote for a bill that would codify <i>Roe vs. Wade</i>,” Scheller said at the debate, according to the <a href="https://www.lehighvalleylive.com/elections/2022/04/lehigh-valley-congressional-debate-features-china-accusations-differences-on-abortion.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Lehigh Valley Live&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.lehighvalleylive.com/elections/2022/04/lehigh-valley-congressional-debate-features-china-accusations-differences-on-abortion.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22420000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22420001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Lehigh Valley Live</a>.</p>
<p>Scheller's fervor underscores one of Democrats' lingering fears after the <i>Roe</i> opinion breach — that the GOP could benefit from an even bigger enthusiasm surge in November, since abortion opposition has driven that party’s religious conservative base to the polls for decades.</p>
<p>“Republicans need a date to vote" and little else, quipped McFarland, the Allentown Democrat who recently retired after 30 years in the public school system. "We need a person, we need a reason."</p>
<p>But if Democrats can muster turnout this fall that's anything like the Women’s March she attended after Trump's victory, she vowed: “Women will save democracy.”</p>

<p>OTTAWA, Ont. — The Trudeau government wants it known that Canada is open to any Americans who may need to travel north to access an abortion.</p>
<p>Senior Cabinet ministers have been making<b> </b>the point in the wake of a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3272-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff7cad0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1651759720970,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000177-20dd-de27-a5f7-3fff8beb0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1651759720970,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000177-20dd-de27-a5f7-3fff8beb0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-948d-d7d2-adbc-fe9f1cb30001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;draft opinion obtained by POLITICO&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-948d-d7d2-adbc-fe9f1cb30000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">draft opinion obtained by POLITICO</a> that suggests the U.S. Supreme Court is poised to overturn <i>Roe v. Wade</i> and federal abortion rights in America.</p>
<p>Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino said Wednesday that he's consulted the Canada Border Services Agency to ensure entry guidelines are clear, "so that women who may not be able to access health care including access to abortion are able to come to Canada."</p>
<p>Political reaction in Canada to the draft Supreme Court opinion has been swift, with no shortage of posturing. Americans have always been free to travel to Canada for medical care, for example.</p>
<p>“If an American wanted a medical procedure, they could get one, they would just have to pay for it out of pocket,” Minister of Families, Children and Social Development Minister Karina Gould told reporters Wednesday on her way into a Liberal caucus meeting. “There’s no reason why we would turn anyone away to receive that procedure here.”</p>
<p>But the reality on the ground in Canada is far more complicated.</p>
<p>Anyone who travels north for health care will discover that the system is stretched and waiting lists are long<b> </b>for many types of medical care. Abortion services are no different.</p>
<p>“They're going to be in for a little bit of a rude awakening in terms of the lack of access in this country,” Mohini Datta-Ray, executive director of Planned Parenthood Toronto, told POLITICO when asked about the prospect of an American influx. </p>
<p>“I think Canada is often seen as a utopia in the U.S.”</p>
<p>Foreigners are free to use services provided by Canada’s public health care system as long as they pay their own costs or they are covered by insurance.</p>
<p>If the U.S. Supreme Court were to adopt the draft majority decision, the step could <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/03/bortion-statistics-by-state-map-00029740" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;immediately restrict access to abortion in at least 23 states&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/03/bortion-statistics-by-state-map-00029740&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22480000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22480001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">immediately restrict access to abortion in at least 23 states</a>, including the border states of Michigan, Idaho and North Dakota. While access to the procedures would likely be maintained in other U.S. states, the changes could encourage some Americans to consider Canada as a friendly option for reproductive services.</p>
<p>But access to abortion services, which have been decriminalized in Canada, can be a challenge, especially for Canadians outside of urban areas. Some must travel for hours, often across provincial boundaries, to the nearest clinic.</p>
<p>In Canada’s big cities, where services are easier to find, landing an appointment — and quickly — is not always as simple.</p>
<p>“Wait lists are through the roof,” said Datta-Ray, whose organization has partnerships with clinics across the Toronto region. “The places that do provide abortion or reproductive care in this country are overwhelmed."</p>
<p>Abortion Rights Coalition of Canada executive director Joyce Arthur says while there are barriers for Americans — like travel expenses, the need for a passport and fees for the procedure itself — she expects future changes in the U.S. will boost demand at Canadian clinics.</p>
<p>“That could impact everyone up here looking for services as well, in terms of waiting times and being able to get in,” Arthur said this week. “It's a very time-sensitive procedure, and once you've decided to have an abortion, staying pregnant is very psychologically taxing.”</p>
<p>Datta-Ray said medical abortions cost between C$875 and C$971 at the Toronto-area clinics, while surgical abortions can cost between C$531 and C$2,400.

<p>Meghan Doherty, director of global policy and advocacy for Action Canada for Sexual Health and Rights, said in an interview that services offered in Canada are not designed to absorb a great number of patients from outside the country.</p>
<p>“But there will be a lot of people who will be working day and night to provide care that is needed,” she said.</p>

<p>The availability of services across the provinces and territories is uneven, even though the Canada Health Act is supposed to ensure equitable access to health care services. In New Brunswick, for instance, surgical abortions are only offered in a few hospitals.</p>
<p>Doherty said Canadians could feel the effects of <i>Roe v. Wade</i> being overturned in another way: the potential loss of access to critical U.S. abortion procedures later in pregnancy. The availability of abortions for pregnancies more than 24 weeks is limited in Canada, she said.</p>
<p>"The impact of <i>Roe v. Wade</i> potentially being struck down will have ripple effects here for sure," Doherty said. "It does put an onus on the provincial and federal governments to make sure that those services are available in people's own communities, so that they don't actually have to travel and they don't need to be reliant on a country that is trying at every step of the way to restrict access to abortion."</p>
<p>While Canada’s political discourse on abortion is far more subdued than the bare-knuckle public debates in the U.S., the issue remains especially sensitive for the Conservatives, who draw considerable support from voters opposed to abortion.</p>

<p>The challenge for Conservatives is that <a href="https://dartincom.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/PostMedia-Abortion-Feb-F-1-2020.pdf" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;polls have shown&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://dartincom.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/PostMedia-Abortion-Feb-F-1-2020.pdf&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22480006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22480007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">polls have shown</a> a clear majority of Canadians believe people should be able to have an abortion regardless of the reason.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberals have long tried to brand themselves as strong supporters of abortion rights — and have done their best to needle their Conservative rivals about it. Trudeau’s Liberals have also promised to fight for more access to abortion procedures.<br><b> </b><br>During last fall’s election, the Liberals made several commitments to improve access to abortion services.</p>
<p>The pledges included establishing regulations under the Canada Health Act to ensure “that no matter where someone lives, that they have access to publicly available sexual and reproductive health services.” If a province failed to comply, the Liberals said they would empower Ottawa to withhold federal health-care transfers to the province.</p>
<p>Pressed Wednesday about the government’s lack of progress on the abortion access file, Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos promised announcements soon.</p>
<p>He told reporters the government has been advancing a C$45-million program to increase access and information about abortion services. He promised more work to step up enforcement measures for provinces who fail to offer an adequate level of service.</p>
<p>“Every year, there are provinces and territories whose funding from the federal government is cut because they don't provide abortion and reproductive services in the way that they should,” he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>MONTREAL, Que. — When non-conservative politicians bring up abortion on Parliament Hill, critics are quick to accuse them of using scare tactics, fear mongering and political opportunism. </p>

Wade</i>. The blockbuster news from the U.S. is stirring the abortion debate in Canada, especially in the context of the race to lead the national Conservative party. With candidates set to square off in Ottawa on Thursday, timely polling suggests a significant majority of Canadians want their party leaders to support women's right to choose.</p>
<p>In March 2022, as the Conservative leadership race was getting underway, <a href="https://2g2ckk18vixp3neolz4b6605-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Federal_Politics-March-2022_1.pdf" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;a Léger poll&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://2g2ckk18vixp3neolz4b6605-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Federal_Politics-March-2022_1.pdf&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd224b0008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd224b0009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">a Léger poll</a> found 67 percent of Canadian voters would prefer that the next leader of the Conservative Party of Canada support abortion rights, against only 12 percent who would like them to oppose those rights. (Another 21 percent did not know, or else said it did not matter.) </p>
<p>It is a rare occurrence when voters from all major federal parties agree on anything, but abortion appears to be one issue that goes across party lines. </p>
<p>Even among Conservative voters, a majority (56 percent) want their next leader to support abortion rights, against only 19 percent who would prefer the leader to be against — a three-to-one ratio. Three quarters of Liberal and NDP voters say they'd prefer the next Conservative leader support abortion rights — even though, from a purely cynical and strategic point of view, perhaps some Liberals would not mind seeing their main rival siding with such an unpopular view among the Canadian electorate.<br></p>
<br>
<p>We don't have to look back far to find a Conservative campaign derailed by its leader's stance on abortion. </p>
<p>In 2019, with the Liberals and Conservatives in a statistical tie throughout the country, and with Conservatives poised to makes gains in rural and suburban Quebec, it took all but five minutes from the start of the first French language debate for Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and Bloc Leader Yves-François Blanchet to corner a bumbling Andrew Scheer on his abortion stand. </p>
<p>The Conservative leader stressed he would not reopen the issue if he were prime minister, but he could not swim<b> </b>away from the issue, and the damage was done. In the days that followed, the CPC quickly dropped in the polls in Quebec, Blanchet lead his Bloc Québécois to a resurgence in Quebec and Trudeau went on to win reelection, albeit with a minority government.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Léger fielded the exact same questionnaire to its online panel in January 2020, shortly after Scheer resigned (and at the start of the race that led to the nomination of his replacement, Erin O'Toole). Back then, 60 percent of Canadian voters expressed their preference for a CPC leader who supports abortion rights, including 47 percent of CPC voters (<a href="https://2g2ckk18vixp3neolz4b6605-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Federal-politics-January-07-2020-1.pdf" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;see poll report here&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://2g2ckk18vixp3neolz4b6605-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Federal-politics-January-07-2020-1.pdf&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd224b000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd224b000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">see poll report here</a>), meaning Léger has observed a statistically significant increase of support for a CPC leader who supports abortion rights: seven points among all voters (60 to 67 percent) and nine points among CPC voters (47 to 56 percent).<br></p>
<br>
<p>We need to be cautious when comparing polling results from different firms, because wording and polling methods can have a notable effect on the results.

<p>Opinion polling in Canada clearly shows that pushing to restrict abortion is a risky and highly unpopular political strategy, which could cost the Conservatives much needed support, especially among women voters and in urban Canada. </p>
<p>Evidently, CPC strategists and Bergen have seen the same data, which helps explain why she felt some of her MPs should be muzzled on a potentially explosive issue. One can easily see how this turn of events could risk derailing an already divisive CPC leadership race. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As the U.S. and its allies increase their commitment to arming Ukraine, there’s growing speculation over President Joe Biden’s endgame. Although the White House has gone to great lengths to say the United States does not have a policy of promoting regime change in Russia, there’s no question that there has been much discussion in private conference rooms and over kitchen tables about whether the United States should, in fact, be rooting for Vladimir Putin to be removed as Russia’s president.</p>
<p>To figure out whether we would be better off without Putin, though, we first need to weigh something else: How would Putin’s departure from power affect Russia? Would a leader or system that came after him be better or worse?</p>
<p>For years, many within the Russia-watching community have argued that Putin’s departure would likely unleash instability inside Russia and exacerbate its foreign aggression. For instance, a new leader who needed to consolidate power could stoke nationalist or anti-Western undercurrents already present in Russia to boost public support. Or, lacking Putin’s ability to balance Russia’s competing factions, elite infighting could spark political upheaval and violence that could destabilize the country, which after all is a nuclear power. According to this line of reasoning, Putin’s critics should be careful what they wish for: a Russia without Putin <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/04/12/regime-change-russia-putin-00023953" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;could be even worse for the West&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/04/12/regime-change-russia-putin-00023953&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd224f0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd224f0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">could be even worse for the West</a>.</p>
<p>This view held some intellectual merit prior to Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, but now that argument is growing weaker by the day. To justify the war, Putin has stoked a dark and ugly nationalism inside Russia. His propaganda has convinced many Russians of the legitimacy of his senseless “de-nazification” campaign in Ukraine, so much so that some Russians have come to view the killing of Ukrainian civilians as acceptable.

<br>
<p>We have studied autocratic regimes for many years, and the empirical record increasingly supports the conclusion that a Russia <i>with Putin</i> is likely to be worse than one without him.</p>
<p>In our research, we have analyzed the leadership transitions of autocrats who have been in power for 20 years or more, as Putin has been, to gauge what is likely to happen once Putin leaves power. Narrowing in on this subset of longtime leaders is important because most authoritarian leaders govern for less than a decade, and the political outcomes that follow longtime leaders’ departures from office differ considerably from their less durable authoritarian peers. The historical track record of longtime autocrats suggests that if Putin exited office as a result of domestic dynamics — that is, from coups, protests, or natural death in office — Russia’s political trajectory would be unlikely to get worse in terms of repression and aggression than it is now and might even improve.</p>
<p>Take political stability. Russia’s own Communist past could be seen as supporting concerns about the potential for instability in Putin’s wake. After all, when Russia’s longest serving leader, Joseph Stalin, died in office after 29 years, a power<b>&nbsp;</b>struggle erupted over who would succeed him. Nikita Khrushchev eventually emerged on top, but he was subject to efforts by rivals in the Politburo to oust him and was eventually removed in a palace coup after nine years. Yet, despite this period of leadership uncertainty, conditions in the Soviet Union improved markedly after Stalin died. Moreover, Russia’s post-Stalin experience holds limited relevance for understanding Russian dynamics today because <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00396338.2017.1375229?journalCode=tsur20" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;political dynamics in autocracies have changed&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00396338.2017.1375229?journalCode=tsur20&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd224f0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd224f0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">political dynamics in autocracies have changed</a> significantly since the end of the Cold War, including in the ways that autocrats come to and fall from power.</p>
<p>When looking at leadership transitions of longtime authoritarian leaders in the post-Cold War era, we see that coups and wide-scale protests are no more likely to erupt in the years after such leaders leave office then while they were in it. In those cases where coups or mass protests did occur, the country was more likely to have a level of wealth substantially lower than in today’s Russia. In Côte d’Ivoire, for example, former President Félix Houphouët-Boigny died in office in 1993 after ruling for 33 years; his successor, Henri Konan Bédié, was toppled in a coup in 1999. In Indonesia around the same time, mass protests led to the ouster of longtime strongman Suharto in 1998 and continued the following year until his successor, B. J. Habibie, was forced out too. Russia is significantly wealthier than both countries.</p>
<p>The same pattern emerges when examining more significant forms of instability such as state-based armed conflict, or domestic instability involving at least 25 battlefield deaths. Looking at the post-Cold War period, the chance of such conflict in any given year is 27 percent during longtime authoritarian leaders’ tenures. The year after these leaders leave office, it decreases to 11 percent and in the 10-year period that follows, the overall average is 16 percent. Here too, rates of state-based armed conflict tend to be lower after longtime authoritarian leaders leave power.</p>
<p>To be fair, in all likelihood, authoritarianism in Russia will persist beyond Putin. This has been true in 75 percent of cases most like Putin’s Russia. Sometimes, the same authoritarian regime remains intact, as it did in Cuba following Fidel Castro’s retirement in 2008 or Zimbabwe following the coup that ousted Robert Mugabe in 2017 after 30 years in power. In others, a new autocracy emerges, as in Rwanda following the overthrow of Juvénal Habyarimana in 1994. In fact, authoritarianism is so persistent in the wake of the departure of longtime personalist leaders because the tactics they use to prolong their rule — quashing the opposition, silencing civil society and hollowing out institutions — create environments inhospitable to the emergence of democracy.<br></p>
<br>
<img src="https://static.politico.com/34/ab/53b79ae54f2ba20ab09e6eee8e9e/https-delivery.gettyimages.com/downloads/1058566896">
<br>
<p>But even a new autocrat at the helm could change the tone of Russian politics, as the four-year term of Dmitry Medvedev as Russia's president demonstrates. Although the contours of Russian foreign policy remained intact from 2008 to 2012 (the years he served as president while Putin stepped into the prime minister role), the switchover to Medvedev created new opportunities for engagement with Russia even as Putin continued to hold the real power. It was under Medvedev, for example, that the United States and Russia concluded the New START nuclear arms control treaty and Russia allowed Washington to expand a logistics network in Central Asia needed for transporting American equipment to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>But it’s not just that political conditions are unlikely to be worse in post-Putin Russia; there is also substantial upside potential. Here again, Russia’s comparatively higher level of wealth provides it some advantages: Although economic riches help authoritarians survive longer in office, they also improve the chance of democracy should the leader exit power. Wealth helps dictatorships withstand the “<a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-polisci-050718-043546" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;stresses of modernization&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-polisci-050718-043546&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd224f0006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd224f0007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">stresses of modernization</a>,” but it also increases the likelihood they will succumb to pressures for popular government upon the leader’s departure.</p>
<p>Chances for liberalization would be even greater if Putin exits amid street protests instead of a coup. In the five-year period after protests unseated post-Cold War longtime autocrats, all countries but one saw a new regime emerge — and importantly, in half of those cases the new regime was democratic. This is because when protests unseat a leader, the transition is often accompanied by more significant turnover among the ruling elite relative to other modes of transition like coups. And even if democracy doesn’t emerge immediately, the historical record shows that levels of repression tend to improve in the years following a longtime authoritarian leader’s exit.</p>
<p>The United States has long had a Russia challenge, but in the last two months it has become evident that it will be impossible to address that broader challenge with Putin still in power. Of course, it would be imprudent for the United States to adopt a formal policy of regime change, but Washington need not pull any punches in fear that what follows Putin would be worse. The patterns of post-Cold War history suggest that political dynamics in Russia are unlikely to get worse and might even get better once Putin departs.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In an almost offhand fashion last week, Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told several congressional committees that his Department of Homeland Security had created a new body, the Disinformation Governance Board (DGB). He offered few specifics as to how it was combating disinformation, and few have come since, apart from his meaningless comment that the DGB would have no “operational authority or capacity.” In short, the message amounted to “There’s nothing to see here or worry about.”</p>
<p>We disagree, and we have seen this saga before. An episode from over a hundred years ago tells us a great deal about how such a venture can go wrong, and to some extent already has.</p>
<p>We refer here to the Committee on Public Information, created by President Woodrow Wilson on April 14, 1917, one week after the United States entered World War I. This was done through a three-sentence executive order that offered no meaningful specifics other than that the CPI would be headed by the pyrotechnic, muckraking journalist George Creel.</p>
<p>Wilson seems to have had in mind that the CPI would be responsible for censoring information that compromised military operations. This, of course, was a matter of legitimate concern. But in the next 18 months that the war lasted, the CPI grew willy-nilly into a ministry of propaganda. “There was no part of the great war machinery that we did not touch, no medium of appeal that we did not employ,” Creel wrote after the war in his book <i>How We Advertised America</i>. It was one of the few times he made an understatement. The CPI soon began declaring “the facts,” calling out Americans who dared to dissent, and even chastising small town editors who took minor exception to administration policy.</p>
<p>Commenting on the creation of the DGB while making the rounds of talk shows last Sunday, Mayorkas admitted, “We probably could have done a better job of communicating what it does and does not do.” The mea culpa, such as it was, could have applied to the creation of the CPI and went much deeper than the failure to put out a press release ahead of time.<br></p>
<br>

<br>
<p>As with the casual announcement of the birth of the DGB, the rollout of the CPI was no rollout at all. Like the new DGB, the CPI had a name that was meaningless. It did not function as a committee any more than the DGB will govern. The order creating the CPI was signed on a Saturday, a day when many journalists are resting from their week’s work. There had been no planning as to what the CPI would do. Worse, Wilson did not consult with legislators ahead of time to develop support for even his rudimentary ideas.</p>
<p>The lack of accountability was compounded further because Wilson was able to fund the CPI out of a war chest that did not require congressional oversight, and Senate confirmation wasn’t required to bless Creel’s appointment. This set the organization up for constant criticism. Lawmakers, even those from Wilson’s own Democratic Party, were suspicious of the CPI. It became a convenient vehicle for partisans to indirectly attack Wilson.</p>
<p>The appointment of Creel was another major misstep. Anyone heading a government bureau of information should possess a squeaky-clean record for even-handed, fact-based utterances. This could not be said of Creel. From his early days in Kansas City and later Denver, his crusading journalism was overwrought and his political alliances never far from the surface. Creel’s work on Wilson’s 1916 reelection campaign endeared him to the president, who needed little persuasion to put him in charge of the CPI. At the time of his appointment, the <i>New York Times</i> said it could not identify “any evidence of the ability, the experience, or the judicial temperament required ‘to gain’ the understanding and co-operation ‘of the press.’” By the time the CPI folded at the end of the war, the term Creeling was a byword in the capital for what is today called spinning and fake news.</p>
<p>The appointment of Nina Jankowicz as executive director of the DGB is similarly ill-advised. She is a skilled researcher-writer and a bona fide expert in disinformation. But Jankowicz has drawn criticism for comments that smack of political bias, among other things appearing to wholly dismiss the Hunter Biden laptop controversy as Russian disinformation. Nor does it help that her book <i>How to Lose the Information War</i> takes more than a passing swipe at Donald Trump and his congressional supporters, as does a clever, if slightly cringeworthy, <a href="https://twitter.com/wiczipedia/status/1362153807879303171" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;music video&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/wiczipedia/status/1362153807879303171&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22520000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22520001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">music video</a> she made about disinformation. The head of the agency dealing with facts needs to be seen as being above the political fray.</p>
<p>The biggest problem, however, was with the very idea of a government agency monitoring truth. To be clear, a democracy depends on the government’s provision of facts, whether trade statistics or transparency on what it is doing (such as creating a body tasked with sorting out disinformation). <a href="http://kevinrkosar.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Hamilton-Kosar-white-paper-on-propaganda-2016.pdf" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1651693155310,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-1f7f-d00d-a3c6-bf7f17e20001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1651693155310,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-1f7f-d00d-a3c6-bf7f17e20001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://kevinrkosar.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Hamilton-Kosar-white-paper-on-propaganda-2016.pdf&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-9095-d337-a9cc-ba9d6bb20001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;But as we have argued elsewhere&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-9095-d337-a9cc-ba9d6bb20000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">But as we have argued elsewhere</a>, it is not easy to draw the line between provision of fact and using taxpayers’ dollars to shape their views with one-sided information.</p>
<p>The CPI is, above all, an object lesson in this. Some of its work was valuable. It started a publication that can be seen as the forerunner of our <i>Federal Register</i>, which makes government contracts public, and it pioneered the concept of public diplomacy.</p>
<p>Despite its claims to provide only facts, however, it could not resist playing on emotions and providing tendentious information that fed on unfounded fears of German spies lurking everywhere. Those “spies,” in effect, were people who challenged Wilson administration policies.</p>
<p>The Biden administration is right to call out disinformation by the Russians and anyone else. It should thwart misinformation that encourages immigrants to cross the border, as Mayorkas has said the DGB would do. Indeed, if we are going to have a Disinformation Governance Board, its energies should be directed solely to disinformation that indisputably originates from outside the country.</p>
<p>But if America learned anything from its experience with the CPI, it is this: An organization that is ill-defined can be anything it wants to be and suspected of anything partisan critics want the public to think it is. And that is particularly perilous when that organization is a governmental entity that has the power to speak directly to 330 million Americans.</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security has a lot of work to do before this Disinformation Governance Board can seem like a remotely good idea. Congress would be well advised to press Mayorkas to clarify the role of DGB both now and going forward.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<br>
<p>The 2024 election begins as a high-stakes staring contest.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump have both told aides and confidants that they’re more likely to run for the White House next cycle — and confident in their chances of winning — if the other runs, too. But as each camp gears up for a rematch of the bitterly contested 2020 contest, there remains a small hiccup: Neither is inclined to take the plunge first.</p>
<p>It’s a game of political chicken that — as described by more than a half dozen advisers to the two men — has largely frozen the field among Democrats and Republicans alike, raising questions about the future health of two parties being led by a pair of candidates who, by that Election Day, would have long ago celebrated their 75th birthdays.</p>
<p>“It’s a very unusual situation where there are people in both parties who would likely clear the field, and for the first time in modern history we might not have a very competitive primary on either side,” said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist who was a senior adviser on Sen. Marco Rubio’s presidential bid. “So it’s hard to think of what that would look like other than it being a brutally long election campaign.”<br></p>
<br><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6301734956001" frameborder="0"></iframe> 
<br>
<p>Inside the White House, for now, it’s all systems go for 2024. An official decision has not been made and may not for some time, according to three administration officials not authorized to discuss private deliberations. But Biden has repeatedly said he plans to seek reelection, and White House aides and Biden advisers are taking initial steps to mount a bid, believing he has a strong record and would overcome intraparty concerns about his age — on Election Day 2024 he will be just shy of 82 — and shaky poll numbers.</p>
<p>He has little choice to say otherwise; an admission that he was making himself a lame duck would dramatically curb his political power. Some Democrats have expressed private hope that Biden will make his final decision soon after this November’s midterms, giving the party plenty of time to prepare for what would likely be a wide-open primary if he opts not to run.</p>
<p>But presidents often wait until after the midterms to declare a reelection candidacy, in part because of the campaign finance restrictions that doing so would bring. On a personal level, moreover, acting promptly is not a Biden strength, sparking fear within the party that an announcement could be delayed until deep into 2023. The one factor that could hasten a decision and all but certainly ensure that Biden runs again: if Donald Trump says he will, too.</p>
<p>The current president has had repeated conversations with allies that he would need to run again to prevent Trump from reclaiming the Oval Office. Like he did in 2020, Biden views Trump as an existential threat to American democracy. And like he did in 2020, Biden thinks he’s the only one who can beat him. He plans to more aggressively target Trump as the midterm season approaches — both as a means of turning around his party’s standing for the midterms but also to set up a contrast for the future.</p>
<p>“This MAGA crowd is really the most extreme political organization that's existed in recent American history,” Biden said on Wednesday.<br></p>
<br><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6305616913112" frameborder="0"></iframe> 
<br>
<p>But Trump is in no hurry to move first. He has hinted strongly that he will run again, but advisers don’t expect a decision until much closer to the midterms. Barely a year since leaving office in disgrace, Trump has enjoyed reclaiming his perch atop the GOP and playing kingmaker in the primary season — as reinforced by J.D. Vance’s victory Tuesday in the Ohio Senate GOP primary. But he has not committed even privately to running himself. And he has admitted that he is hesitant to announce soon, because once he does he would be restricted in how he could utilize and coordinate with certain political committees tied to him.</p>
<p>Even his closest allies are left to read the tea leaves. Trump’s enthusiasm to hold rallies, his flirtations with a 2024 run in media interviews, and his super PACs’ deep coffers, advisers say, are all signs he is likely to run again. But he also remains obsessed with relitigating 2020 more so than taking concrete steps to prepare for 2024. Relatedly, they add, he would likely jump into the fray if assured that Biden was running too.</p>
<p>“Biden running helps shape his decision. I think it’s an opportunity to avenge a loss and right a wrong, whereas if there was a younger candidate, I don’t know how motivated he’d be,” said a former adviser to Trump.</p>
<p>The potential rematch would have only one historical parallel. In 1888, President Grover Cleveland’s reelection bid was toppled by Benjamin Harrison. But four years later, Cleveland defeated Harrison in their rematch, becoming the only president to serve two non-consecutive terms.</p>
<p>Trump’s pollster, John McLaughlin, said his firm’s surveys show that the 45th president is favored to walk in Cleveland’s dusty footsteps.

<p>“If they keep attacking him, he’ll run,” McLaughlin said. “If they keep trying to attack him and his supporters — Trump’s the type of person where if you tell him he can’t do something and if you personally keep attacking him, he’s going to try to prove you wrong.”<br></p>
<br>
<p>But some Trump allies believe he may ultimately opt against a run, either for health reasons or, if Biden’s poll numbers rebound, because he doesn’t want to risk a second loss, even though he has yet to acknowledge the first defeat.</p>
<p>So far, a slew of prominent Republicans have begun making overt moves to run in 2024. Whether they will abandon their own White House dreams if the former president were to run again is another matter entirely.</p>
<p>Former Vice President Mike Pence, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Sens. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) are among those who made appearances in early voting states, and some have started securing top political consultants. Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley has hinted she’d mount a bid but wouldn’t run against Trump if he decides to enter the race. Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson has suggested he may run even if Trump does. And there is Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has emerged as an heir-apparent to Trump and the populist MAGA movement.</p>
<p>Things may be just as uncertain on the Democratic side of the ledger. If Biden opts against seeking reelection, the field may not clear out for Vice President Kamala Harris, who has yet to find her political footing in the role. Two 2020 candidates, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.), each have held recent high-profile events on hot button election topics.</p>
<p>If Biden opts to seek a second term, a serious primary challenge would be unlikely.</p>
<p>"Everything is frozen until after the midterms. I expect Biden to run, I hope he runs. And I think if there is a credible primary challenger against Biden there is almost a certain Trump victory,” said Paul Begala, former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>Historically, incumbent presidents have a losing track record if someone from their own party poses a significant challenge: Gerald Ford in 1976, Jimmy Carter in 1980, and George H.W. Bush in 1992 all held off their primary opponents but emerged wounded and later would lose the general election.</p>
<p>During the 2020 campaign, there was some idle chatter in Biden’s campaign of making a one-term pledge, becoming a “transitional” president who would rid the nation of Trump and then usher in a new era of Democratic leaders. But those ideas were dismissed even before Biden took the oath of office.<br></p>
<br>
<p>Still, some allies and Democrats privately worry that Biden may not be able to handle the rigors of another campaign.</p>
<p>A bone he broke in his foot while playing with his dog in late November 2020 still occasionally bothers Biden, resulting in a slower and shorter gait. And the White House has largely abandoned using the Oval Office for press events in part because it can’t be permanently equipped with a teleprompter; Biden aides prefer the fake White House stage built in the Old Executive Office Building next door for events, sacrificing some of the power of the historic backdrop in favor of an otherwise sterile room that was outfitted with an easily read teleprompter screen.</p>
<p>And if Biden were to run again in 2024, it almost certainly would be a more rigorous campaign than the one he previously mounted. The outbreak of Covid kept Biden in his Delaware home for much of the 2020 general election campaign, sparing him the wear and tear of relentless travel.</p>
<p>As for Trump, the issues are not related to physical health so much as psychological conditioning. He wants to run, those who know him say, but wants to be sure he will win.</p>
<p>"I always said that he would run if Biden is under 44 or 43 [percent] but if Biden is at 46, 47, he will pass,” said Bryan Lanza, a GOP strategist and former Trump campaign official. “Right now he is at 41 so I have to say yes right now — there has to be a dramatic turning out in Biden numbers for him to pass."</p>]]></content:encoded>

<br>
<p>Mitt Romney and Josh Hawley, polar opposites in today’s GOP, agree on one thing: Donald Trump’s status as Republican kingmaker.</p>
<p>After the former president’s endorsement of a former critic rocketed J.D. Vance to the GOP Senate nomination in Ohio, the two senators can’t help but see things the same way. Hawley (R-Mo.), who led Trump-backed election challenges in the Senate last year, observed that “he’s the leader of the party, that’s clear … If he decides to run, he will be the nominee.”</p>
<p>And while Romney twice voted to convict Trump in impeachment trials, speaking out against him more than any other sitting GOP senator, the Utah Republican also concluded that anyone who argues the former president is fading away is not tethered to reality.</p>
<p>“I don’t delude myself into thinking I have a big swath of the Republican Party,” Romney said in a Wednesday interview. “It’s hard to imagine anything that would derail his support. So if he wants to become the nominee in ‘24, I think he’s very likely to achieve that.”<br></p>
<br>

<br>
<p>Though Tuesday was just one night in a crowded spring primary calendar, Trump’s romp in Ohio signals that — for all the talk of his waning influence after losing in 2020 and getting impeached for inciting an insurrection — the GOP is still in his thrall. He’s unlikely to topple several sitting governors he’s gone after. But when it comes to federal primaries, Trump far overshadows every other GOP figure, from the establishment to party gadflies, according to interviews with nearly a dozen GOP lawmakers.</p>
<p>Trump-endorsed House candidates Max Miller and Madison Gesiotto Gilbert cruised through their respective Ohio primaries on Tuesday night. In the northwest corner of the state, J.R. Majewski, a Trump fanatic known for using paint to transform his lawn into shrines to the former president, notched an upset of two better-funded rivals.</p>
<p>That was just one week after Trump praised Majewski and his landscaping at an Ohio rally for Vance.</p>
<p>“There's never been an endorsement in American history that has the political punch that President Trump's endorsement has,” said Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio).</p>
<p>At the moment, Vance’s flailing-to-sailing campaign is a case study in Trump's ability to change the game for a candidate down the stretch. Vance was dead in the water two months ago, but Trump’s mid-April endorsement plus <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/03/jd-vance-win-ohio-primary-00029881" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1651704050005,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-7543-d47e-ab7e-fd73d7140000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1651704050005,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-7543-d47e-ab7e-fd73d7140000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/03/jd-vance-win-ohio-primary-00029881&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-913b-d7d2-adbc-ff3baded0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;big spending&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-913b-d7d2-adbc-ff3baded0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">big spending</a> by a Peter Thiel-backed super PAC vaulted him over his primary rivals Josh Mandel, Mike Gibbons, Matt Dolan and Jane Timken.</p>
<p>Six years ago, retiring Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) significantly outpaced Trump in 2016 as he romped to reelection in Ohio, even after rescinding his endorsement of the then-presidential nominee. Things looked much different this time around: Portman’s preferred candidate Timken ended up in fifth place, torched by a brief defense of Rep. Anthony Gonzalez’s (R-Ohio) impeachment vote that lost her Trump’s potential backing.</p>
<p>“I told you the endorsement was going to matter. And it did,” Portman said of Trump backing Vance. “He has a very high approval rating among Republican primary voters.”<br></p>
<br><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6305598017112" frameborder="0"></iframe> 
<br>
<p>It also didn’t hurt that in Ohio “you had two other frontrunner candidates who almost beat each other up on stage,” quipped Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), referring to a televised clash between Gibbons and Mandel during a primary debate.</p>
<p>Ohio won't end debate over Trump’s GOP sway after four chaotic years in the White House; in fact, his pull will be tested on a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/03/2022-primary-election-dates-schedule-midterm-calendar-00029417" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;weekly basis this spring&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/03/2022-primary-election-dates-schedule-midterm-calendar-00029417&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22670000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22670001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">weekly basis this spring</a>. And if he can replicate his performance in Ohio in most races, there will be little doubt that Trump’s blessing is determinative in open seats.</p>
<p>“When Trump endorsed, Vance was in fourth place. And he rocketed to the front on the shoulders of Trump’s endorsement,” said Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who campaigned for Mandel in Ohio. “It has been obvious for a long time that he has enormous influence in the party, that Republicans strongly support President Trump, and they care about his leadership.”<br></p>
<br>
<p>Still, Cruz said he wouldn’t be dissuaded from campaigning for Republican hopeful David McCormick in Pennsylvania’s Senate race just because Trump’s endorsement cost Mandel the primary. </p>
<p>As to whether Trump is the frontrunner for the 2024 nomination, Cruz said of his former 2016 rival: “I think Trump always feels like the frontrunner in every circumstance.”</p>
<p>After 18 months of build-up, the primaries are now coming fast, starting next week with a West Virginia battle between Republican Reps. David McKinley and Trump-backed Rep. Alex Mooney, as well as a Nebraska gubernatorial race in which Trump endorsed Charles Herbster, who — like the former president — has faced accusations of sexual assault.<br></p>
<br><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6305495296112" frameborder="0"></iframe> 
<br>
<p>After that comes open Senate GOP primaries in Pennsylvania, where Trump endorsed TV personality Mehmet Oz over business executive McCormick, and North Carolina, where he picked Rep. Ted Budd over former Gov. Pat McCrory and former Rep. Mark Walker. Trump’s also struggling to dislodge Idaho Gov. Brad Little.</p>
<p>Then comes Georgia, where Gov. Brian Kemp has a steady lead over Trump-backed former Sen. David Perdue and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger squares off against Trump ally Rep. Jody Hice. Trump yanked his Senate endorsement of Rep. Mo Brooks in Alabama after Brooks’ numbers sank down the stretch, raising eyebrows among Senate Republicans. He’s expected to endorse one of Brooks’ rivals. </p>
<p>That's all within the next month.</p>
<p>Trump will struggle to win all of those races. And his allies are hoping Trump would be a gracious loser — a high bar for a man who still refuses to admit he lost to Biden.</p>
<p>“If one of his preferred candidates loses down the road, I hope he’ll do the same thing everybody else should do, which is get behind the person that won,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who called Trump’s endorsement “outcome-determinative” for Vance but also laughed that “70 percent of the people voted for somebody else” in Ohio.</p>
<p>In Georgia’s Senate race, Trump essentially ended the Republican primary before it even started by anointing Herschel Walker to challenge Democratic incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock. Republicans have barely lifted a finger to try and stop the scandal-plagued Walker given his popularity among GOP voters, reasoning that if they are going to win the seat they have to do it with Trump’s candidate. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell endorsed Walker last year.<br></p>
<br>
<p>So far, Senate Republicans have only sought to protect Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) from Trump’s wrath after he endorsed primary challenger Kelly Tshibaka in Alaska. He’s stopped trying to topple Senate Minority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.), perplexing the No. 2 GOP leader. </p>
<p>Asked why Trump has gone quiet in his reelection race, Thune responded: “Good question. I don’t have any answer to that.”</p>
<p>Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) offered one explanation: that Thune is so popular in the state that he’d be difficult to beat under any circumstance. And in high-profile Senate races, Trump’s been relatively strategic. He endorsed Vance and Oz late to help push them over the top and has stayed away from scandal-plagued former Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens’ Senate bid.</p>
<p>Trump's also aligned with the deep-pocketed Club for Growth to help vault Budd into the lead in North Carolina, two factors that when combined “have a pretty big impact,” said National Republican Senatorial Committee Chair Rick Scott (R-Fla.). That pro-Budd alliance comes after Trump and the Club supported different candidates in Ohio.</p>
<p>But even where Trump hasn’t endorsed, the GOP primaries are mostly about Trump anyway.</p>
<p>“He’s ramping up his activity. He’s doing more rallies, he’s getting more involved in these races,” Hawley said. “He doesn’t have to be involved in these races. Because everyone’s claiming his mantle anyway.”</p>

<br>
<p>It started the way all Washington’s spiciest scandals start — with a departmental<b> </b>working group.</p>
<p>Over just a few days last week, the creation of a new board in the Department of Homeland Security generated an outcry on the right, from genteel retiring lawmakers to the loudest hosts on Fox News. It found its way to congressional Republicans’ oversight to-do lists. The secretary of Homeland Security was forced to address the allegations on multiple Sunday shows. And the board’s new executive director <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/04/30/another-music-video-of-biden-disinfo-boss-nina-jankowicz-surfaces/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1651696826398,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-7543-d47e-ab7e-fd73d7140000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1651696826398,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-7543-d47e-ab7e-fd73d7140000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://nypost.com/2022/04/30/another-music-video-of-biden-disinfo-boss-nina-jankowicz-surfaces/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-90cd-d3ee-a392-91df751c0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;went very, very viral&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-90cd-d3ee-a392-91df751c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">went very, very viral</a>.</p>
<p>It was dramatic. But it didn’t start that way.</p>
<p>“The irony is that this board is really kind of boring,” said a DHS official who was not authorized to address the topic on the record. “It was designed to protect against the very thing that we’re being accused of doing — that is, it was designed to protect the free speech, privacy, civil rights and civil liberties of all Americans.”</p>
<p>It hasn’t even convened its first meeting, but already the Disinformation Governance Board — a small group created to work on a complicated problem — has become a big headache.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">Extremely online problems</h3>
<p>The Senate confirmed Alejandro Mayorkas as DHS secretary on Feb. 2, 2021. In his confirmation hearing, held just two weeks after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, he promised to take on domestic violent extremism, calling it “one of the greatest challenges that the Department of Homeland Security confronts.”<br></p>
<br><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6228483857001" frameborder="0"></iframe> 
<br>
<p>Early in Mayorkas’ tenure at DHS, his team saw that malicious internet activity fed virtually every problem the department faced, according to John Cohen, a top counterterrorism official in the department at the time who helped stand up the board. This activity took a host of shapes: domestic violent extremists threatening members of Congress, human smugglers enticing migrants by spreading lies about U.S. border policies to entice migrants, Russian intelligence officers posting false claims about U.S. elections, and so on.</p>
<p>DHS leadership stood up a working group on the issue, said Cohen, who left the department last month. That group was helmed by the Office of Policy and the Office of Intelligence and Analysis. Its members concluded<b> </b>last year that there wasn’t a mechanism to address the policies governing how these activities are coordinated across the sprawling department, Cohen said.</p>
<p>One particular concern was that some DHS components — like Immigration and Customs Enforcement — can legally go undercover online (for instance, to infiltrate a human smuggling organization’s chat group). But for others, like I&amp;A, going undercover is prohibited. Were there policies in place to make sure that when different agencies within DHS shared information with each other, it was all done appropriately?</p>
<p>It’s Washington, so the working group concluded that there needed to be another new group working on these issues. Cohen wrote a memo describing a board that would do just that. He noted it’s no secret that the department has long grappled with how to fight disinformation, going as far back as <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/publication/lessons-learned-social-media-hurricane-sandy" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Hurricane Sandy&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.dhs.gov/publication/lessons-learned-social-media-hurricane-sandy&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd226c0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd226c0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Hurricane Sandy</a> in 2012.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>“They’re not sitting there saying, ‘Hey, what should we be doing about Russian disinformation focusing on X, Y, and Z?’” he told POLITICO. “They’re focusing on, ‘Hey, information is being gathered and collected under different sets of legal authorities. What is the appropriate way to share that information so we’re not in conflict with those legal authorities?’”</p>
<p>“It’s not a good use of time to be angry about the creation of a policy coordination group,” he added.<br></p>

<br>
<h3 style="text-align: left">A controversial pick</h3>
<p>Earlier this year, department leadership decided to stand up the disinformation board, according to the DHS official. The pick for director was disinformation expert Nina Jankowicz, who managed programs for Russia and Belarus for the National Democratic Institute and has advised the Ukrainian government, <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/person/nina-jankowicz" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;according to her biography&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.wilsoncenter.org/person/nina-jankowicz&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd226c0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd226c0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">according to her biography</a> at the Wilson Center. She’s also written two books: <i>How to Lose the Information War: Russia, Fake News, and the Future of Conflict</i>; and <i>How to Be a Woman Online: Surviving Abuse and Harassment, and How to Fight Back</i>.</p>
<p>The DHS official told POLITICO that Jankowicz started at the department on March 2. In mid-April — after she started at DHS but before her hiring became public — she did an interview with NPR promoting her second book, which focuses on harassment women face online.

<p>“We need the platforms to do more, and we frankly need law enforcement and our legislatures to do more as well,” she told NPR.</p>

That same day, in congressional testimony before a House Appropriations subcommittee, Mayorkas talked up the board as a major new step in the department’s fight against disinformation.</p>
<p>“We have just established a mis- and disinformation governance board in the Department of Homeland Security to more effectively combat this threat, not only to election security but to our homeland security,” he said.</p>
<p>It was an odd comment, given that DHS now says the board does not run or manage any department operations.</p>

<p>This weekend, Mayorkas made the rounds of the Sunday shows and tried to do some clean-up.</p>
<p>“We could have done a better job of communicating what it is and what it isn’t,” he said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”</p>
<p>That was a bit of an understatement.<br></p>
<br>
<p>“They only have themselves to blame for this firestorm,” said Ben Wizner, director of the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. “They announced something with a creepy name and provided no information about the scope or authorities of the board.”</p>
<p>DHS officials will have ample opportunities to answer more questions in future Congressional hearings. Republicans plan to make the board a major focus if the House flips in November.</p>
<p>“Efforts are afoot to begin serious oversight of this,” said a Congressional Republican aide who works on investigations. “We see it as fundamentally un-American.”</p>
<p>The board’s defenders, meanwhile, plead innocence. The DHS official said nobody there expected the outcry against the board, and that they would have put more thought into its name if they’d had better foresight.</p>
<p>And, Cohen said, protecting Americans’ rights while combating disinformation is of paramount importance.</p>
<p>“There is no area of national security that isn’t impacted by this,” he said. “None.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>J.R. Majewski twice painted his lawn into a massive shrine of former President Donald Trump. He raised thousands of dollars to escort a group to Washington for the Jan. 6 rally that preceded the Capitol riots. A recent TV ad showed him walking through a shuttered warehouse with an assault-style rifle, vowing to do “whatever it takes” to restore the country to its “former glory.”</p>
<p>And as of this week, he is the GOP’s nominee in one of the party’s top 2022 target House districts — despite more than $500,000 in spending from establishment Republicans who had hoped to boost a more moderate state senator with a bipartisan streak.</p>

<p>In a special primary election in Minnesota to fill the seat of the late GOP Rep. Jim Hagedorn, the two front-running candidates are the establishment-backed former state Rep. Brad Finstad and state Rep. Jeremy Munson, who is endorsed by leaders of the House Freedom Caucus.</p>
<p>And that's just in May.</p>
<p>“It's the go-along-to-get-along crowd versus someone who's going to join the House Freedom Caucus, and really try to hold the line and make a course correction in government, which is what I want to do,” said Munson, one of four state representatives who broke from the Minnesota state House GOP and created their own caucus. “I definitely have a record of standing up to leadership.”</p>
<p>The stakes in Washington are high: Republicans worry the party could face an extreme version of the internal gridlock that plagued them under former Speakers John Boehner and Paul Ryan.</p>
<p>"My fear is that in this election — not just my election, but across the country — is: We take the majority, but we don't have a big enough majority and we end up like the Democrats are now, in reverse,” said Idaho’s Simpson, a self-described compromiser who faces a primary rematch with an ultraconservative 2014 challenger. “And we get pulled further and further right by the right wing. That's damaging to us."</p>
<p>“If you cannot ever compromise, you cannot govern,” Simpson continued, quoting 19th-century statesman Henry Clay, a former speaker of the House.</p>
<p>Defending Main Street, the political arm of the Republican Main Street Partnership, has spent some $370,000 on ads to aid Simpson, according to the ad-tracking firm AdImpact.</p>
<p>That group and the Chamber of Commerce — and, more rarely, the McCarthy-aligned super PAC, Congressional Leadership Fund — are often the vanguard of the “governing wing.” The Club for Growth and House Freedom Caucus, and sometimes Trump, tend to line up with hardliners.

<br>
<p>Nearly every politician commits an<b>&nbsp;</b>occasional gaffe, and nearly every election features at least one news cycle about something stupid that a candidate did or said.</p>
<p>Even so, the recently concluded Ohio Republican Senate primary was uniquely stupid, by almost any standard. The election was unrivaled in the number of times the candidates debased themselves for attention, said something absurdly provocative or committed an act of epic buffoonery, perpetuating a spiral of attacks against each other that<b>&nbsp;</b>generated a flood of local and national headlines.</p>
<p>Now that the nomination has been clinched by best-selling author J.D. Vance — leaving some of his opponents with nothing to show for their millions in out-of-pocket spending — let’s review the moments over the past year that led to this race to the bottom, and the prospect that it will be remembered as one of the dumbest Senate primaries ever.<br></p>
<br>
<h2 style="text-align: left">The near brawl</h2>
<p>It became an iconic moment of the 2022 midterm elections: Two candidates, after months of desperate attempts to get former President Donald Trump to notice and endorse them, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQLhKrAHWlY" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1651686886006,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014f-1278-d3b2-a96f-1a793dc80004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1651686886006,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014f-1278-d3b2-a96f-1a793dc80004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQLhKrAHWlY&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-9035-d337-a9cc-babdb49a0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;standing chest-to-chest on a stage seemingly on the brink of throwing punches&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-9035-d337-a9cc-babdb49a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">standing chest-to-chest on a stage seemingly on the brink of throwing punches</a>.</p>
<p>As they traded schoolyard insults, a debate moderator had to step in between Mike Gibbons, a 70-year-old investment banker, and Josh Mandel, a 44-year-old former state treasurer, before anyone could take a swing.</p>
<p>The March skirmish resembled a scene from the Jerry Springer Show — or a skit before a WWE match.</p>
<p>“You've never been in the private sector in your entire life,” Mike Gibbons, a 70-year-old investment banker, said to Josh Mandel, a 44-year-old former state treasurer, state representative, city council member and Marine.</p>
<p>“I've worked, sir,” Mandel said, jumping to his feet to confront Gibbons, who was standing as he spoke. “Two tours in Iraq. Don’t tell me I haven’t worked.”</p>
<p>“You. Don’t. Know. Squat,” Gibbons said.</p>
<p>The debate moderator hustled across the stage to try to calm the men down, placing a hand on each of their backs. He slowly guided Mandel back to his chair.</p>
<p>“You don’t know squat!” Gibbons repeated, for good measure.</p>
<p>Before Mandel’s backside could reach the chair, he shot up again. A transcript from the debate details what happened next.</p>
<p>“Two tours in Iraq. Don’t tell me I haven’t worked,” Mandel fired back.</p>
<p>Gibbons: “Back off, buddy, you’re gonna end up …”</p>
<p>Mandel: “You back off!”</p>
<p>Gibbons: “Never. That’ll happen – never.”</p>
<p>Mandel: “Watch. Watch.”</p>
<p>Moderator: “We’ll square it away …”</p>
<p>Gibbons: “You’re dealing with the wrong dude.”</p>
<p>Mandel: “No. No, you’re dealing with the wrong guy. You watch what happens.”</p>
<p>Gibbons: “P----!”</p>
<p>Mandel: “You watch what happens.”</p>
<p>Both men subsequently denied calling the other a “p----.” While attendees in the room initially reported that it seemed like Mandel had used the term, extensive review of multiple video angles by POLITICO revealed it appeared to be Gibbons.<br></p>

<h2 style="text-align: left">The ‘inadequacies’ of Timken’s male opponents</h2>
<p>Former state party chair Jane Timken leaned into the fact she was the only woman in the race, frequently starting her answers during debates and interviews with “As a mother …” and adopting the campaign slogan of “mom on a mission.”</p>
<p>In February, she went further. <a href="https://twitter.com/JaneTimkenOH/status/1494685650712506376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1494685650712506376%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffpost.com%2Fentry%2Fjane-timken-ohio-senate_n_621004dae4b08ed7cf6fcae8" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;In an ad&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/JaneTimkenOH/status/1494685650712506376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1494685650712506376%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffpost.com%2Fentry%2Fjane-timken-ohio-senate_n_621004dae4b08ed7cf6fcae8&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd227c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd227c0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">In an ad</a>, Timken talked about her male opponents’ “inadequacies,” something that was widely understood to be a veiled reference to the size of<b>&nbsp;</b>their genitalia, invoking<b>&nbsp;</b>memories of Sen.

<p>“We all know guys who overcompensate for their inadequacies, and that description fits the guys in the Senate race to a T,” Timken said with a slight smirk, standing next to photos on easels of Gibbons, Vance and Mandel.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left">Standing in a cornfield, warning of the Gestapo</h2>

<p>“I think they were just subject to the lack of technology and their place in the world, because physical labor was so important to making a living.”</p>
<p>Later in the interview, Gibbons criticized his only female opponent, Timken, as someone who had “barely worked,” suggesting she merely married into money. Timken was previously employed as a lawyer and magistrate, and later became chair of the Ohio Republican Party.</p>
<p>Timken spent months accusing Gibbons of sexism, first calling on him to apologize for perpetuating an "offensive stereotype" and suggesting he "may be living in the 1950s."</p>
<p>Months later, at a debate in March, Gibbons clarified that women were “probably oppressed” when they didn’t have a right to vote.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left">‘But he’s Jewish’</h2>
<p>Mark Pukita, a candidate who was rarely included in primary polling — he ultimately won 2.1 percent of the vote — bought radio advertisements last<b>&nbsp;</b>fall alerting voters to the fact that Mandel is Jewish.</p>
<p>Asked about it at a November debate, Pukita <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/11/11/ohio-senate-jewish-campaign-ad-mandel-521007" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;defended the ad&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2021/11/11/ohio-senate-jewish-campaign-ad-mandel-521007&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd227c000d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd227c000e&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">defended the ad</a>.</p>
<p>“In terms of antisemitism, all I did in an ad was pointed out that Josh is going around saying he’s got the Bible in one hand and the constitution in the other. But he’s Jewish,” Pukita said. “Everybody should know that though, right?”</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left">The Cleveland Guardians</h2>
<p>Cleveland’s Major League Baseball team figured prominently in this race, but for the wrong reasons. Trump repeatedly criticized Matt Dolan, the state senator whose family owns the franchise, for the decision to change the team name last year from the Cleveland Indians to the Guardians.</p>
<p>Then there was the subplot involving<b>&nbsp;</b>Bernie Moreno, the former luxury car salesman who dropped out of the race in early February. Moreno said last year he had offered to buy the Indians from the Dolans for $1 billion to keep the team from changing its name. Dolan said that never happened. The two wealthy men went back and forth about whether Moreno had actually tried to buy the Indians.</p>
<p>“It’s not true, so I don’t know why Bernie would decide to say that,” Dolan <a href="https://fox8.com/news/senator-part-owner-of-cleveland-indians-says-political-opponent-never-made-1-billion-offer-to-buy-team/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;told Fox 8 in Cleveland&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://fox8.com/news/senator-part-owner-of-cleveland-indians-says-political-opponent-never-made-1-billion-offer-to-buy-team/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd227c000f&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd227c0010&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">told Fox 8 in Cleveland</a>. “You’re going have to talk to Bernie as to why he thinks he made an offer.”</p>
<p>As part of his efforts to focus attention on the team’s name change — which rubbed many local fans the wrong way — Moreno also told the television station he had an idea to issue a digital currency called “Tribecoin” to allow “people in Northeast Ohio to own part of the team.”</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left"></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: left">‘Twitter isn’t a website’</h2>
<p>Moreno went through a phase last summer when he kept going on Twitter to troll Rep. Tim Ryan, the now-Democratic nominee for Senate.</p>
<p>Except the trolling wasn’t over ideological differences or policy disagreements. Rather it was Moreno lamely attempting to poke fun at the Ohio Democrat. It was often some sort of insult that was difficult to follow, like when Moreno went off on Ryan for <a href="https://twitter.com/berniemoreno/status/1417500653614686210" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;referring to Twitter as a website&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/berniemoreno/status/1417500653614686210&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd227c0011&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd227c0012&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">referring to Twitter as a website</a>.</p>
<p>“Some people on this website think the most important thing about a candidate is their party label,” Ryan tweeted in July.</p>
<p>“Who is going to tell Tim Ryan that Twitter isn’t a website?” Moreno responded in a quote tweet. “Imagine not knowing the difference. This is what happens when you spend your entire adult life in public office. Out of touch politicians deliver predictably bad results!”</p>
<p>Moreno followed up by insisting Twitter “is a microblogging and social networking service on which users post and interact with messages known as ‘tweets’ … Users access Twitter *through* its website interface,” he explained.</p>
<p>In another tweet, Moreno mocked Ryan for sitting in the back seat of a car. Ryan had posted a photo of himself sitting in the vehicle while speaking on a Zoom call to a gathering of young Democrats.</p>
<p>“Also, never trust a guy who sits in the back seat of a car,” Moreno wrote in a quote tweet.</p>
<p>That one didn’t age well: Minutes later, another user replied to Moreno with a selfie that Moreno had previously posted to Twitter of himself sitting in the backseat of a car.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left">‘Childless cat ladies’</h2>
<p> Vance, whom Trump ultimately endorsed in the primary, for a solid week in July kept using the term<b>&nbsp;</b>“childless” in an effort to insult his foes on the left.</p>
<p>“We’re effectively run in this country, via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs, by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too,” Vance told Tucker Carlson at the time.</p>
<p>As examples of childless cat ladies, Vance pointed to Vice President Kamala Harris (who has stepchildren); progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), the youngest woman in Congress; and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who announced a month later he and his husband had adopted infant twins.</p>
<p>Vance has been clear on his position that the American government should incentivize its citizens to have children, and that having kids is the ultimate calling in life.</p>
<p>In a speech during his week of bashing Democrats without children, Vance proposed giving people with kids additional votes at the ballot box, arguing they have a greater stake in the future of the country because they’ve reproduced. When American Federation of Teachers President<b>&nbsp;</b>Randi Weingarten tweeted that week in support of requiring masks in schools, <a href="https://twitter.com/jdvance1/status/1420197895672840196" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Vance jumped in&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/jdvance1/status/1420197895672840196&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd227c0013&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd227c0014&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Vance jumped in</a> to slam her, too, as part of a group of “miserable, childless lefties.”</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left">J.P., er, J.D. Mandel</h2>
<p>By the end of the primary, voters had been inundated with $70 million in Republican advertisements, a dozen debates and, of course, a steady stream of news cycles about what the eight candidates running had said on a given day.</p>
<p>The primary din<b>&nbsp;</b>became so overwhelming, even Trump himself became confused about the name of the man he had recently<b>&nbsp;</b>endorsed, J.D. Vance.</p>
<p>“We’ve endorsed J.P., right? J.D. Mandel,” Trump said at a rally in Nebraska on Sunday. “He’s doing great.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

<br>
<p>Donald Trump Jr., the son of the former president, interviewed with the Jan. 6 committee on Tuesday, according to two people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>He’s the latest member of the Trump family to provide testimony to the select committee probing the Capitol attack, following the panel's interview last month with Ivanka Trump. Trump's son-in-law and former adviser Jared Kushner, as well as Trump Jr.’s fiancée Kimberly Guilfoyle, have also talked to investigators. A spokesperson for the former president’s son did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>The select panel has indicated that it is interested in Trump Jr.’s knowledge of his father’s push to subvert the 2020 election. The committee has also highlighted a text message Trump Jr. sent to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows as a mob overtook the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. In that message, he urged his father to make a more forceful statement to condemn the violence.</p>
<p>“He’s got to condemn this [shit] Asap.

<p>NEW YORK — There's new blood on the board of one of the city’s oldest cultural institutions after Mayor Eric Adams appointed the owner of the Noho club he frequents as a trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>
<p>The mayor quietly named Scott Sartiano, the 47-year-old founder of the members-only <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/05/eric-adams-restaurant-00005935" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3272-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff7cad0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1651626388684,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-264f-dee4-a5ff-ee5ff02b0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1651626388684,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-264f-dee4-a5ff-ee5ff02b0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/05/eric-adams-restaurant-00005935&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-8c9a-d337-a9cc-be9a91dd0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;club Zero Bond,&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-8c9a-d337-a9cc-be9a91dd0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">club Zero Bond,</a> as his representative to the Met board in February.</p>
<p>The unconventional appointment — previous mayoral designees were political and philanthropic heavyweights — gives the club owner an entrée into one of New York’s wealthiest and most influential circles. In turn Sartiano will be an important liaison, communicating both the mayor’s interests to the museum and the museum’s wishes back to City Hall on issues from public funding to neighborhood relations.</p>
<p>“It’s obviously an incredible honor, but it’s also something that has serious bragging rights,” said art dealer Eli Klein, who runs the Eli Klein Gallery in the West Village.</p>
<p>“That gives you a lot of credibility in the art world of course and beyond,” Klein said in an interview.</p>
<p>Elected officials including the mayor, the City Council speaker and the comptroller are ex officio trustees and appoint representatives to be their “eyes and ears” on the board, according to a museum spokesperson. They attend meetings and serve on committees. The position is unpaid.</p>
<p>“The mayor was looking for a New Yorker who could bring a new outlook, as well as a wealth of energy and passion to the role,” Adams’ press secretary Fabien Levy told POLITICO.</p>
<p>“He is looking forward to seeing what Scott and the rest of the board can do for The Met and for the people of New York.”</p>
<p>Sartiano called his appointment “an honor.” </p>
<p>“When serving on the art and institutions committee of Community Board 2, I helped support several art and museum projects. I’ve been an art enthusiast my whole life, and am committed to serving this city and the board with the utmost respect," he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Adams, who eagerly attended the Met Gala Monday night in a bespoke jacket with the message “End Gun Violence” by designer Laolu Senbanjo, also brings a new enthusiasm for the institution following former Mayor Bill de Blasio, who initially <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/05/06/average-guy-de-blasio-says-hes-not-elite-enough-for-met-gala/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3272-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff7cad0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1651626348984,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-264f-dee4-a5ff-ee5ff02b0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1651626348984,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-264f-dee4-a5ff-ee5ff02b0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://nypost.com/2019/05/06/average-guy-de-blasio-says-hes-not-elite-enough-for-met-gala/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-8c9a-d337-a9cc-be9a07da0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;refused to attend&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-8c9a-d337-a9cc-be9a07da0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">refused to attend</a> the museum’s premiere event because he wasn’t an “elite guy.”<br></p>

<p>A museum spokesperson called Adams’ attendance at the gala “a loud and wonderful message” consistent with his belief that the city’s cultural institutions will play an important role in the its comeback from the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Sartiano, who’s best known for dating celebrities in addition to his career as a club and restaurant owner, is a departure from past representatives. </p>
<p>Ken Sunshine, a leading publicist after a career in politics for the late Gov. Mario Cuomo, presidential contender Ted Kennedy and Mayor David Dinkins, was de Blasio’s Met appointee. De Blasio’s predecessor, Michael Bloomberg, named socialite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/06/style/off-and-running-for-the-silk-stockings.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3272-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff7cad0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1651628866272,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-264f-dee4-a5ff-ee5ff02b0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1651628866272,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-264f-dee4-a5ff-ee5ff02b0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/06/style/off-and-running-for-the-silk-stockings.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-8cc0-d7d2-adbc-fed2745c0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;philanthropist Gail Hilson&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-8cc0-d7d2-adbc-fed2745c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">philanthropist Gail Hilson</a> — who fundraised for the Central Park Conservancy and launched with Evelyn Lauder — to the board.</p>
<p>While Sartiano isn’t well acquainted with government or society fixtures, what matters most is his ties to Adams, according to Sid Davidoff, a lawyer and lobbyist who was an aide to former Mayor John Lindsay.</p>
<p>“I know nothing about Scott. All I know is if he has the mayor’s ear on any issue then they made a good appointment. When the Met has a problem the city needs to resolve, he’s the guy that takes it to the mayor,” said Davidoff, who has served as both Adams and de Blasio’s representative to the board of the Wildlife Conservation Society that runs the local zoos and aquarium.</p>
<p>Adams is a regular at Sartiano’s Bond Street club where he held an<a href="https://nypost.com/2021/11/03/mayor-elect-eric-adams-promises-reset-for-nyc-at-celeb-filled-vip-party/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3272-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff7cad0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1651626496435,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-264f-dee4-a5ff-ee5ff02b0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1651626496435,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-264f-dee4-a5ff-ee5ff02b0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://nypost.com/2021/11/03/mayor-elect-eric-adams-promises-reset-for-nyc-at-celeb-filled-vip-party/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-8c9c-d7d2-adbc-fe9e4de10001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot; Election Night after party&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-8c9c-d7d2-adbc-fe9e4de10000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"> Election Night after party</a> attended by actor Forest Whitaker and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. The mayor’s not a member of the $4,000-a-year club, but visits the hot spot as a guest of others who belong and shared a meal with San Francisco Mayor London Breed there in February.</p>
<p>Most Met board members are major art collectors and donors — who give $10 million to the museum in exchange for the privilege of becoming a trustee, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/03/arts/03center.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3272-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff7cad0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1651628843918,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-264f-dee4-a5ff-ee5ff02b0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1651628843918,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-264f-dee4-a5ff-ee5ff02b0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/03/arts/03center.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-8cc0-d7d2-adbc-fed21e8c0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;The New York Times.&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-8cc0-d7d2-adbc-fed21e8c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">The New York Times.</a></p>
<p>“The Met board is the ultimate status symbol in old New York,” said a former member who was granted anonymity to speak openly about the matter.</p>
<p>The former member called Sartiano “a bit of an odd choice [because] he doesn’t come from society, he’s a club owner and a restaurant owner.”</p>
<p>“But, I don’t know," he added, "Everything Eric does is a little different." </p>
<p>Sartiano joins the ranks of an approximately 100-member board that includes present trustees like Merryl Tisch and Anna Wintour and past ones like Cornelius Vanderbilt and Arthur Ochs Sulzberger.<br></p>

<p>A Met spokesperson said in an interview that the mayor’s appointee serves as the “very helpful eyes and ears of the mayor — going both ways.” The appointee shares the mayor’s interests with the museum and the Met informs City Hall’s representative of its own goals.</p>
<p>“The mayor’s representative is an important way for the museum and the city to align on priorities — and the appointment came quickly, and Scott has jumped right in,” Met spokesperson Kenneth Weine added in a statement.</p>
<p>Under past administrations, the mayoral liaison has had to navigate issues related to a lawsuit over the Met’s $25 admission fee, construction noise upsetting neighbors and budget cuts.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>President Joe Biden on Wednesday escalated his rhetorical attacks on the Republican Party and rebuked former President Donald Trump’s enduring grip on the GOP.</p>

<p>“If Mr. Rivera carried out work that requires registration under [the Foreign Agent Registration Act], it is imperative that the Justice Department ensure he is held to account,” Menendez wrote. “The American people deserve to know whether a former Republican member of Congress was secretly doing the bidding of a dictator responsible for committing crimes against humanity in Venezuela.”</p>
<p>Rivera, who represented parts of South Florida until 2013, could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>The Justice Department declined to comment on this story.</p>

<br>
<p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken is the latest top U.S. official to test positive for Covid-19.</p>
<p>The nation’s chief diplomat is experiencing “mild symptoms,” according to State Department spokesperson Ned Price. Blinken has not seen President Joe Biden in person for several days, Price added in a statement.</p>
<p>Blinken’s positive test result came Wednesday afternoon via a PCR test. He was expected to deliver a major speech about China on Thursday, but Price told POLITICO it has been postponed, though he did not immediately name a new date.</p>
<p>Blinken’s Covid-19 case follows a weekend of major gatherings in Washington, many of them linked to the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, which he attended. Blinken has also maintained a strenuous travel schedule in recent weeks.<br></p>

<br>
<p>But Blinken is “fully vaccinated and boosted,” and he’d tested negative on Tuesday and as recently as Wednesday morning, Price said.</p>
<p>“The secretary will isolate at home and maintain a virtual work schedule,” Price said. “He looks forward to returning to the department and resuming his full duties and travels as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>Several top Biden administration officials have tested positive for the virus, including <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/26/kamala-harris-positive-covid-19-00027820" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1651699840266,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017b-546f-d449-a17f-df7fd6960000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1651699840266,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017b-546f-d449-a17f-df7fd6960000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/26/kamala-harris-positive-covid-19-00027820&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-90fb-d337-a9cc-bafb6c220001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Vice President Kamala Harris&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-90fb-d337-a9cc-bafb6c220000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Vice President Kamala Harris</a>, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and White House press secretary Jen Psaki.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<br>
<p>Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes tried to connect with then-President Donald Trump on the evening of Jan. 6, 2021, and urge him to ask the group to forcibly oppose the ascension of Joe Biden, according to a court filing posted on Wednesday in connection with a plea deal by one of Rhodes’ allies.</p>
<p>That evening, after Oath Keepers led by Rhodes departed Capitol grounds, Rhodes gathered members of the group at the Phoenix Hotel in Capitol Hill. There, according to the filing, Rhodes contacted “an individual over speaker phone.”</p>
<p>One of the other members of the group, William Todd Wilson, “heard Rhodes repeatedly implore the individual to tell President Trump to call upon groups like the Oath Keepers to forcibly oppose the transfer of power,” prosecutors say.</p>
<p>“This individual denied Rhodes’s request to speak directly with President Trump,” according to the filing. “After the call ended, Rhodes stated to the group, ‘I just want to fight.’”</p>
<p>It’s unclear whom Rhodes spoke to or whether that individual had access to Trump. The existence of the call was revealed as part of a plea deal between prosecutors and Wilson, who was in frequent contact with Rhodes in the run-up to Jan. 6 and in the ensuing weeks. Wilson on Wednesday became the third Oath Keeper to plead guilty to seditious conspiracy, the gravest charges to emerge from the Jan. 6 insurrection.</p>
<p>Rhodes has ties to some figures in Trump’s orbit, but there’s been little evidence of direct communication on Jan. 6. In previously released text messages sent among Oath Keepers that day, Rhodes lamented that Trump hadn’t exercised emergency powers that he claimed could authorize the Oath Keepers to violently prevent Congress from certifying the 2020 election.</p>
<p>The filing, however, shows that prosecutors are increasingly eyeing ties between the Oath Keepers and people inside Trump’s orbit. One of the group’s other members who pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy, Joshua James, was a member of Roger Stone’s security detail. James is also cooperating with the government following his plea deal.<br></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>With the Democratic runoff three weeks away, Cuellar’s current ads still focus on border security. But Cisneros’ first spot of the runoffs — which has run nearly 500 times on local TV since it launched last week — is a 30-second ad that calls out Cuellar as the “lone Democrat” in the House who voted against codifying <i>Roe v.

<p>“But on May 24, you can have the last word,” the ad said after juxtaposing images of Cuellar with state GOP lawmakers.</p>

<p>ALBANY, N.Y. — A federal judge Wednesday denied Democrats a request for an emergency injunction to have New York use Democratic-drawn district lines for congressional elections. </p>
<p>Then the judge proceeded to relentlessly mock every aspect of their request. </p>
<p>The case stems from the surprise court decision last week to throw out the Democratic-drawn lines for House seats in New York that had left the party poised to pick up at least three seats in November.</p>
<p>“In the 102 years since my father, then a Ukrainian refugee, came into this country, if there were two things that he drilled into my head, they were … free, open, rational elections [and] respect for the courts,” said Southern District of New York Judge Lewis Kaplan, a Democrat. “The relief that I’m being asked to give today impinges, to some degree, on the public perception of both. And I’m not going to do that.”</p>
<p>Kaplan’s hearing, held in Manhattan but conducted primarily by conference call, was the first step in Democrats’ last-ditch attempt to save the lines approved by the Legislature earlier this year. Those lines were <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2022/04/new-york-elections-thrown-into-chaos-after-court-tosses-district-lines-heres-what-happens-next-00028383?source=email" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;blocked by the state Court of Appeals last week&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2022/04/new-york-elections-thrown-into-chaos-after-court-tosses-district-lines-heres-what-happens-next-00028383?source=email&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22960001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22960002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">blocked by the state Court of Appeals last week</a>, and the June 28 primary was soon rescheduled to Aug. 23 to give a judge time to draw new maps.</p>

Since that case, an Albany federal court has needed to sign off on any adjustments to the calendar for congressional contests; since that has yet to happen, the June 28 date should proceed as planned, they argued.</p>
<p>Kaplan was very skeptical that the approval for the August date wouldn’t soon be granted, rendering the entire Democratic argument moot.</p>
<p>Democrats were essentially arguing that the June 28 date “came down on a stone tablet in the middle of the Negev or wherever Moses brought the tablet down from on high,” he said. “There’s just no clear reason to believe that the [military voting] requirements can’t be met by the August date.”</p>
<p>Kaplan thus denied the request for an injunction. Democrats needed to prove a “clear likelihood of success” in future court arguments to receive that.</p>
<p>“This is a Hail Mary pass, the object of which is to take a long shot try at having the New York primaries conducted on district lines that the state says are unconstitutional,” he said.</p>
<p><b>What happens now: </b>Had the injunction been granted, New York would have likely needed to simultaneously proceed with plans for a June 28 primary under the Democratic lines and the Aug. 23 lines that are currently being drafted by a Steuben County court.</p>
<p>The Aug. 23 date and the Steuben County lines are now the only ones on the table, barring some sort of miracle for Democrats in future federal court arguments.</p>
<p>In the coming days, a panel consisting of Kaplan (who was nominated by Bill Clinton) and two judges nominated by Republican presidents will have a full hearing on the Democratic request. Appeals on any decisions that come from those arguments would go directly to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>So currently, June 28 is the date for primaries for statewide and state Assembly races, while Aug. 23 is the date for congressional and state Senate contests.</p>
<p>Democrats do have the option of passing legislation to push back the races due to be held in June to coincide with those in August, but it’s still far from certain if that will happen.</p>
<p>“I don’t know why we would continue to disrupt the process,” Gov. Kathy Hochul said on Tuesday. “It’s still a little fluid … but the path right now is to continue with June 28 for statewide primaries.”</p>
<p>“I’m happy that under our leadership in 2019, <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2019/01/10/democrats-plan-sweeping-election-reform-package-next-week-784148" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;one of the first things we did&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2019/01/10/democrats-plan-sweeping-election-reform-package-next-week-784148&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22960005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22960006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">one of the first things we did</a> was combine the [June and September primary dates] because we understood that not only was it an expense but it was confusing,” said Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins (D-Yonkers). “So obviously our general policy has been to combine where we could.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

<br>
<p>Throughout the last half century, two assertions about abortion have been widely accepted:</p>
<p>First, if <i>Roe v. Wade</i> was ever overturned, abortion would once again become a matter for the states to decide. The practice would be banned, restricted, permitted or subsidized depending on the political terrain: California and Idaho would be very different places. Federalism in action.</p>
<p>Second, if <i>Roe</i> was ever overturned, the political fallout would benefit Democrats, who reflect the majority opinion that support <i>Roe</i>. Republicans would face a reckoning at the ballot box.</p>
<p>Today, neither of these assertions are nearly as certain as they once might have been. And if the second assertion proves false — if the abortion issue either lacks political punch or in fact turns out to be an asset for abortion foes — then the first assertion may be on shaky ground.</p>
<p>To put it more bluntly, it is at least plausible that in the early days of 2025, a Republican Congress will pass, and the new Republican president will sign, a law effectively outlawing abortion <i>everywhere in the United States.</i> Whatever the voters of California or New York or New England wish will simply not matter. Further, such new laws would likely be far more restrictive than the laws that were in place before <i>Roe v. Wade</i> was ever decided.</p>
<p>In his draft opinion disclosed by POLITICO, Justice Samuel Alito embraces the view held most consistently and forcefully by the late Justice Antonin Scalia: The Constitution has nothing whatsoever to say about abortion. There is no such right, he says, to be found anywhere in the document or in its amendments. Without <i>Roe</i>, the decision devolves, appropriately, to the political class — to legislators and elected executives.<br></p>
<br>
<p>This has always meant that states are where decisions are to be made. The federal government has made policy at the margins: The Hyde amendment bars federal funding of abortion; Congress banned so-called late-term abortions almost 20 years go, and aid to groups offering abortions flows and recedes depending on which party is in the White House.</p>
<p>But divisions in Congress, as well as the one-time presence of many pro-abortion rights Republicans and anti-abortion Democrats, have made sweeping federal laws all but impossible to enact. Today, as Democratic leaders try to codify abortion rights protections, they face the same obstacles they have faced in enacting sweeping social spending measures or voting rights laws; there are 50 Democrats, one of whom (Joe Manchin) is a foe of abortion rights, and another (Kyrsten Sinema) who will not support putting aside the filibuster to pass such a law. The two Republican senators who back abortion rights — Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins — do not support a temporary pause on the filibuster either.</p>
<p>The answer to this obstacle, the argument goes, lies in the impending political response to the court’s pending decision. Citing polls that show a clear majority in favor of maintaining <i>Roe</i>, some progressives see this fall’s midterms as a chance to elect more allies to the House and Senate to put a bill on President Joe Biden’s desk that in effect legislates the protections of <i>Roe</i> — a process even this Supreme Court might find hard to strike down.</p>
<p>Here’s the problem: The reaction to the end of <i>Roe</i> may not be what proponents hope it will be.</p>
<p>First, the polls on abortion are murky; depending on how the question is asked, you get very different responses. Yes, most believe the decision should between a patient and their doctor; <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2022/05/03/how-americans-really-feel-about-abortion-the-sometimes-surprising-poll-results-as-supreme-court-reportedly-set-to-overturn-roe-v-wade/?sh=1af38d367ac1" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;most believe&nbsp;<i>Roe</i>&nbsp;should be retained&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2022/05/03/how-americans-really-feel-about-abortion-the-sometimes-surprising-poll-results-as-supreme-court-reportedly-set-to-overturn-roe-v-wade/?sh=1af38d367ac1&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22980000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22980001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">most believe&nbsp;<i>Roe</i>&nbsp;should be retained</a>. In another poll, a plurality believe <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/06/07/730183531/poll-majority-want-to-keep-abortion-legal-but-they-also-want-restrictions" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;abortion should be more restricted&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.npr.org/2019/06/07/730183531/poll-majority-want-to-keep-abortion-legal-but-they-also-want-restrictions&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22980002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22980003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">abortion should be more restricted</a>; a fifth believe abortion should always be illegal, a quarter believe that abortion should always be legal. Add to this the wide variances depending on states, and the political impact of the issue becomes even more clouded. The issue plays very differently at the state level, which is why, even before the draft <i>Roe</i> decision came out, a near-majority of states had either enacted restrictions, including outright bans, or passed “triggering” laws to go into effect as soon as <i>Roe</i> is formally overturned.</p>
<p>Second, as a voting issue, abortion has tended to work on behalf of the side dissatisfied with the status quo. If you believe <i>Roe</i> was misguided, or evil, you want the policy to change. The most dramatic example of this came in 2016, when a Supreme Court seat was clearly on the line in the presidential race. Twenty percent of voters said the court was <i>the</i> major issue of the race; among those voters, Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton 56-41. It was a key reason why Trump won the evangelical vote, despite his previous escapades and vulgar behavior.<br></p>

<br>
<p>If the energy behind abortion depends on who is most discontent with the status quo, then shouldn’t the pro-abortion rights side benefit from the overturn of <i>Roe</i>? There are two reasons to be cautious. First, the issue in November may not be as much of a motivating political force compared with, say, inflation. Second, for the foes of abortion, overturning <i>Roe</i> is only a first step; leaving the decision to the states still means hundreds of thousands of abortions every year.</p>
<p>In a prescient story, published just hours before the Alito draft opinion was disclosed, the <i>Washington Post</i> reported that national anti-abortion groups are planning “a push for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/05/02/abortion-ban-roe-supreme-court-mississippi/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1651690494975,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000179-e6ba-d193-a1f9-effa7fdf0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1651690494975,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000179-e6ba-d193-a1f9-effa7fdf0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/05/02/abortion-ban-roe-supreme-court-mississippi/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-906c-dd36-a38c-d76cd43e0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;a strict nationwide ban&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-906c-dd36-a38c-d76cd43e0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">a strict nationwide ban</a> on the procedure if Republicans retake power in Washington. … The discussions reflect what activists describe as an emerging consensus in some corners of the antiabortion movement to push for hard-line measures that will truly end a practice they see as murder while rejecting any proposals seen as half-measures.”</p>
<p>The increasingly draconian measures enacted or simmering at the state level — outright bans, attempts to ban pregnant people from traveling out of state for abortions, attacks on the “morning-after” pill — reflect a militancy, or extremism, that is about to become a force across the Republican field. The same polarization that has effectively weeded out pro-abortion rights Republicans and anti-abortion Democrats in Washington means that GOP candidates will be positioning themselves harder and harder to win the support of social conservatives, for whom “leave it to the states” will be weak tea.</p>
<p>The argument here is not that abortion will sweep Republicans into power in Congress this fall; it’s that the historical drag on Democrats, Biden’s weak approval ratings <i>and</i> the possibility of energized voters on both side of the abortion issue will produce a GOP Congress in November, whose members will be disposed — out of conviction or political pressure — to vote for a national ban.</p>
<p>That dynamic is likely to be present in 2024. If Trump runs, he will run as the hero of the social right — the candidate who promised to appoint anti-abortion judges, and who did. If he doesn’t run, those who would be his heirs will be looking to stake out the same kind of ground Trump did in 2016. A national abortion ban, at least in the Republican primaries, would be a powerful argument. As for its impact in a general election, Republican moderates have been predicting for 40 years that a hard-line approach on abortion would be political suicide. The 1980 GOP platform called of an outright ban on abortion — and that fall, Ronald Reagan won 44 states. It could be that the idea of a national ban is a bridge too far; but the millions of New Yorkers and Californians won’t be voting Republican anyway. To put it mildly, the expectation that abortion extremism would hurt Republicans has been essentially unfulfilled for decades.</p>
<p>So, if in 2025 a Republican Congress and a Republican president seek a national ban, won’t the same filibuster that has bedeviled Democrats block Republicans? Sure — unless you remember that the Senate’s biggest filibuster champion, Mitch McConnell, had no qualms about dropping the 60-vote threshold for Supreme Court nominees when Neil Gorsuch was up for confirmation. If Democrats could spend years demanding an end to the filibuster, at least for voting rights, then there’s no reason to think a foolish consistency would stop Republicans from scrapping it if the issue was “protecting innocent human life.” Indeed, depending on the nature of the Senate GOP caucus, it may be McConnell’s way of saving his leadership. (All this assumes that Republicans won’t accumulate a 60-vote majority after the 2024 campaign — a year with a daunting Senate map for Democrats.)</p>
<p>And make no mistake: Such a law would not show many signs of accommodation. <i>Roe’s</i> foes have made a point of noting that before the 1973 decision, a third of the states changed their laws to make abortions available under a wide set of circumstances. (Reagan regretted that he’d signed a bill as California governor making the procedure widely available). But a national ban enacted by Republicans is unlikely to give much weight to the preferences of New Yorkers or Californians; spurning liberals in blue states might even be part of the law’s appeal.</p>
<p>What I’ve outlined here is only a possibility. Now that the repeal of Roe is all but certain, the scrapping of a half-century-old right could trigger a rush to the polls that upends the conventional wisdom that Democrats will be swamped in November. If Democrats can hold the White House in 2024, the national abortion ban idea disappears, at least for four years. There may also be institutional Senate Republicans who would refuse to scrap the filibuster.</p>
<p>What’s striking, however, is that the bedrock assumption of what a post-Roe world would look like — 50 states each with their own policies — may wind up being far different than what we might be living with a few years from now.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This week Americans learned that <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, almost certainly the most famous Supreme Court precedent and which recognized a constitutional right to abortion, was set to be overturned, leaving the question of abortion up to the states. In the immediate aftermath of the biggest breach in Supreme Court history, political pundits across the spectrum divided on the potential motive of any leaker. But there appeared to be near-universal agreement that this would have an enormous impact on the midterm elections.</p>

The race wasn’t able to be called on Election Night; Murphy eked out a win by barely 3 points.</p>
<p>Almost a year since the Texas law went into effect, politically speaking, abortion was the dog that didn’t bite.</p>
<p>At its most basic level, there are two ways a political issue can affect an election. Either it causes a meaningful number of voters to switch from one candidate to another or it increases turnout by motivating people disproportionately on one side of an issue to vote who otherwise would have stayed home.</p>
<p>On the first point, the question is whether there are any voters left who would change their votes based on the outcome of the Supreme Court’s decision in <i>Dobbs. </i>After decades of abortion litmus tests for candidates, what if the vast majority of voters already changed parties at some point to align with their beliefs on abortion or aligned their beliefs with their party’s increasingly firm ideological stand on the issue?</p>
<p>In the 50 years since Roe was decided, the two political parties have shifted to become almost synonymous with their positions on this singular issue.</p>

<p>The second issue is whether this could tighten the enthusiasm gap between Republicans and Democrats in the run-up to the midterm elections. The country saw some of the highest voter turnout in modern history in 2018 and 2020. Many believed — and not without good reason — that the high turnout was driven on both sides by Donald Trump. But in 2021, Virginia saw the highest percentage of voters in any gubernatorial election since 1997. Just last month, Texas held the first primary for 2022, breaking turnout records in the state. If voters are already highly engaged in the current political moment, then <i>Dobbs</i> could only help Democrats if they are able to find Americans who stayed home in 2018 — at the height of the Trump presidency — who are only now motivated to vote for a Senate candidate who campaigns, for example, on voting for a federal law to enshrine a right to abortion.</p>

<p>The real political fight may be <i>within</i> the parties. Thanks to the Supreme Court, both Democrats and Republicans have been able to have their cake and eat it too when it comes to abortions, talking a big game but avoiding specifics on when abortions should be banned because <i>Roe </i>stood in the way of any real political accountability.</p>
<p>In the 2020 Democratic primaries, Elizabeth Warren refused to name “any limits on abortion” that she would support. But most Americans are unlikely to support elective abortions at 39 weeks. In the meantime, Republican state legislators have passed sloppily drafted laws that they knew wouldn’t go into effect under <i>Roe</i>, including laws that could criminalize the removal of an ectopic pregnancy — a tragic and common complication that will never result in a live birth and could kill the mother in the meantime.</p>
<p>Both parties are about to learn that legislative cosplay is all fun and games until the courts return the issue to voters and their elected representatives have to actually govern.</p>

Many of those states — like Florida, South Carolina and Indiana — are controlled by Republicans. The rest — like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Arizona, New Hampshire and North Carolina — have mixed party control at the state level or in statewide office. And all of those states have competitive Senate elections this year. Those are the states where we would expect abortion to have its greatest political impact. But after the results in New Jersey and Virginia last year, we all may need to rethink whether abortion is the wedge issue it used to be.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Last night at 8:32 p.m., POLITICO reporters Josh Gerstein and Alexander Ward punctured the court’s reputation as a leak-proof vessel by plastering the internet with a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;majority draft opinion&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22a50001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22a50002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">majority draft opinion</a> written by Justice Samuel Alito that would reverse 1973’s <i>Roe v.

<p>How has the Supreme Court kept a relatively tight lid on its workings compared to the CIA, the NSA, the Pentagon, the FBI and other government appendages? For one thing, it’s smaller by multiple degrees. The fewer secrets you handle, the easier the job. But the court has long occupied a sacred and mythic place in the national consciousness, a place that the court itself has cultivated.

<p>The late Justice Antonin Scalia became famous for making his clerks pledge silence about what they saw and heard. “I only want to say it once,” a Scalia clerk remembers him saying. “If I ever discover that you have betrayed the confidences of what goes on in these chambers, I will do everything in my power to ruin your career.” (A clerk <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2022/05/02/leak-time-magazine-roe-wade/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1651624669046,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017b-843d-d1d1-a57f-d53f02e80000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1651624669046,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017b-843d-d1d1-a57f-d53f02e80000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2022/05/02/leak-time-magazine-roe-wade/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-8c80-dd36-a38c-cfcc6a3d0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;leaked the original <i>Roe</i> decision&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-8c80-dd36-a38c-cfcc6a3d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">leaked the original <i>Roe</i> decision</a> to <i>Time </i>magazine back in 1973.

<p>The POLITICO exclusive did the nation a service by ignoring the magic fairy dust that envelops the court to take an overdue look at the court’s decision-making process. The story was all the more warranted because if we had a viable Congress, it would have sorted out the legality of abortion by now. Instead, we’ve shunted to the Supreme Court the job of legislating what the abortion law should be. Viewed from that angle, the POLITICO scoop is less an intrusion into the Supreme Court’s sanctified domain than it is an investigation into a piece of evolving legislation. (As noted everywhere, the Alito draft is only a draft, and subject to change.)<br></p>

<p>Would Congress scream murder if one of its bills under consideration leaked to the press? Of course not. Its draft legislation gets aired all the time. So why the hubbub over the Alito draft? For one thing, it violates the court’s mania for secrecy, a mania that’s rational. The court has long feared that if the nation knew how its decisions come together — if its members dared to wear human faces, if it appeared as anything but a sacred tribunal — its decisions would carry less weight. It’s that easy to lose the mystique built up for centuries. The POLITICO piece reveals a court-decision-in-process as a purely political document that aligns five conservatives against the court’s liberals and, presumably, the chief justice. That accurate portrayal might take decades for the court’s myth-makers to erase.</p>
<p>The court hasn’t had to worry about leaking opinions because it’s not in the interest of most of its beat reporters to pursue them.

<p>Chief Justice Roberts issued a statement today bemoaning the “betrayal of the confidences of the the court” and “egregious breach of trust.” His histrionics were loud enough to carry all the way down Constitution Avenue to the Reflecting Pool, as he called for an investigation into the leak. <a href="https://www.unlv.edu/people/stephen-bates" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Stephen Bates&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.unlv.edu/people/stephen-bates&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22a70002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22a70003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Stephen Bates</a>, a journalism professor and legal scholar, thought his complaint was a bit overboard. “The court does seem like a pretty frail institution if its legitimacy is crumbling because of one leak.

<p>It appears that no law was broken, unless the leak was the product of a break-in or hack. “I’d be really surprised if it ended up with any kind of criminal charge,” University of Texas Law School Professor Stephen I.

<p>The leak has obviously dinged the Supremes’ legal supremacy for the moment. They will recover. But the upside of the leak is grand. The public has gained a new awareness of where a court majority plans to take the nation after a half-century of legal abortion. Getting a two- or three-month preview of that plan in a midterm year straight from the horse’s pen amounts to a journalistic coup of the highest order. The government works to keep you in the dark. The press to shine the light. Heaven bless the press.</p>

<br>
<p>For decades, activists across the political spectrum have believed that Supreme Court justices are pretenders — ideologues and partisan hacks who try to disguise personal agendas behind black robes.</p>
<p>Justice Samuel Alito’s startling draft opinion revoking a constitutional right to abortion, joined by four colleagues to form a provisional narrow majority, puts this old critique in a somewhat new light: Ideological aims and partisan ones are at least partly in tension.</p>
<p>On narrowly partisan grounds, not many Republican operatives would advise that the best strategy for the 2022 midterms and 2024 presidential elections is to put abortion rights front and center in a consuming national debate. But if the court follows through with its draft opinion — obtained by POLITICO and published Monday night — front and center is where it will be, even as polls consistently show majorities of 60 percent or more wish to leave the 1973 <i>Roe v. Wade</i> decision intact.</p>
<p>Alito plainly does not care about that.<br></p>
<br>
<p>For years, on abortion, the Supreme Court’s conservative majority has been divided by jugglers and brawlers. Jugglers, led by Chief Justice John Roberts, have tried to balance competing principles — a willingness to revisit <i>Roe&nbsp;</i>at margins while also respecting precedent and trying to preserve the mystique of oracular detachment on which he believes the court’s legitimacy depends.</p>
<p>The brawlers, led in this instance by Alito, say to hell with that.</p>
<p>His draft opinion on <i>Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization </i>— the case has not yet entered the national shorthand, <i>What’s your view on Dobbs?,</i> but presumably soon will — runs for 98 pages of argument and citations. But its essence can be summed up in three words: Bring it on.</p>
<p>Let’s stop pretending, he writes in bristling, vehement words that he plainly has been sharpening in his mind for decades, that intensely opposing views about the morality of abortion can or should be resolved by the courts. Let’s recognize, he argues, that much of the language swirling around the legal debate — Latin phrases like <i>stare decisis</i>, medical concepts like fetal viability or gestational trimesters, and so on — is so much sophistry and an evasion from the heart of the matter.</p>
<p>As he sees it, the heart of the matter is that there is no legitimate constitutional right to abortion and never was — “<i>Roe</i> was egregiously wrong from the start” — and so the whole matter should be thrown to the political arena. That’s where one of the most intimate dimensions of human life can be debated in a loud, thrashing, angry debate, right out in the open.</p>
<p>Even people who have labored for decades to preserve a woman’s right to decide for herself whether to carry a pregnancy might agree there is something crisp and free of pretense about where a majority of the Supreme Court appears ready to go. In recent years, many of these activists — seeing the legal foundations of <i>Roe</i> gradually eroding — have voiced their own version of the Alito argument: <i>OK, then, you want a political fight? Let’s have it.</i><br></p>
<br>
<p>Historically, many abortion rights supporters have believed that putting that debate out in the open — and on the ballot — at a moment when the stakes are undeniably clear is a winning proposition for them. The logic is that anti-abortion activists are always focused and hyper-engaged, while the broader majority who supports abortion rights often will organize and vote on the issue when they feel their rights are imminently threatened.</p>
<p>A related argument is that <i>Roe v. Wade</i> had the opposite effect of what many of its backers wanted. Instead of removing the issue from politics, a backlash to the court was the engine for a new conservative movement in the 1970s. It may even have inhibited the process by which political debate in the states was gradually leading to more liberal laws and possibly a more durable consensus on abortion rights. In some moods, such feminist legal pioneers as the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg explored this possibility. Alito, almost tauntingly, quotes her from 1992 (a year before joining the high court) on how <i>Roe</i> may have “prolonged divisiveness” and “deferred stable settlement of the issue.”</p>
<p>It is hardly the most relevant angle on the story — not compared to the tangible, real-world effect on individuals if the draft opinion or something close to it is what the Supreme Court decides in its official decision in coming weeks — but one must note that there is plainly a kind of rough-hewn principle in Alito’s thinking.<br></p>
<br><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6285063971001" frameborder="0"></iframe> 
<br>
<p>He clearly has strong ideological views, but that makes it harder to level a charge of partisanship — especially if Democrats are able to mobilize voters around abortion rights.</p>
<p>Compare this case, for instance, to the 2000 case of <i>Bush v. Gore.</i> Then, a narrow majority of Republican-appointed justices seemingly put partisanship over legal principle when they ignored their own pious sermons about interpreting the Constitution narrowly to invent an ad hoc rationale that awarded a disputed presidential election to George W. Bush.</p>
<p>Alito doesn’t look to be guilty of that kind of hypocrisy. His eagerness to attack <i>Roe v. Wade</i> has been obvious since he joined the court in January 2006. He seems entirely sincere when he writes in the draft that justices should not be “affected by any extraneous influences such as concern about the public’s reaction to our work.”</p>
<p>Fidelity to his own principles seems closely linked to another trait that jumps off the page of his draft. He comes off as a contentious, self-assured loudmouth. Many passages sound less like a formal legal ruling than the argumentative tones of a relative who gets carried away at Thanksgiving — <i>Do we have to talk politics over dinner? </i>— or the fellow at nearby table at a neighborhood tavern— <i>Sir, would you mind terribly lowering your voice just a little?</i></p>
<p>His draft vibrates with contempt. Arguments made in previous abortion cases are not just misplaced but “very weak,” just as <i>Roe</i> was not just wrong but “egregiously wrong.” He doesn’t stop at saying there was not much support for a constitutional right to abortion until the latter half of the 20th century, he adds: “Zero. None.”</p>
<p>These brawling instincts were apparently compelling — at least in the privacy of Supreme Court chambers — to four colleagues who voted with him: Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett. It’s worth remembering that a draft opinion is a <i>draft</i>: Some of these people may, upon consideration, decide that they would rather try to keep juggling on abortion for a while. That would lead to a more modest final opinion, that trims <i>Roe v. Wade</i> but defers the fateful confrontation that Alito so urgently wants.</p>
<p>Whatever happens, however, the self-confidence of his jurisprudential mind is now part of the public record. It invites the question: What makes him so sure of himself?<br></p>
<br><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6305570233112" frameborder="0"></iframe> 
<br>
<p>The draft opinion is replete with references to the advantages of turning a complicated moral issue over to the political debate in 50 states. But there’s nothing to stop the nationalization of the debate at the congressional level — outlawing abortion everywhere if Republicans chose to do so with a narrow majority next time they take control of Congress, or the opposite when Democrats are in charge.</p>
<p>Alito declares that none of the arguments in his ruling will affect current law on the right to marry or contraception. But he can hardly declare that by fiat, since some of those rights rest on the same legal principles and precedents that buttressed <i>Roe.&nbsp;</i>The idea that abortion will now primarily be the province of the political branches rather than the judicial one seems unlikely. If some states are right that abortion is the equivalent of taking a human life, court cases with plaintiffs that all fetuses in all states have the same constitutional protections are inevitable.</p>
<p>Citing sources from Abraham Lincoln to 20th-century philosopher Isaiah Berlin, Alito reflects on the 14th Amendment’s reference to “liberty” before lecturing, “we must guard against the natural human tendency to confuse what the Amendment protects with our own ardent views about the liberty that Americans should enjoy.” But there is not a hint in the draft opinion that Alito is applying those cautionary words to himself.</p>
<p>Bring it on means bring it on. Neither Alito nor anyone else can be sure what will follow and where it will lead.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<br>
<p>If the draft majority opinion by Justice Samuel Alito disclosed by POLITICO Monday night is any guide, the constitutional right to abortion has only a few days or weeks left to go. The most conservative majority of the Supreme Court that was, already a decade ago, arguably the “<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/supreme-court-may-be-most-conservative-in-modern-history/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;most conservative in modern history&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/supreme-court-may-be-most-conservative-in-modern-history/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22af0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22af0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">most conservative in modern history</a>” has singled out <i>Roe</i> for excoriation and oblivion. But what marked out <i>Roe</i> to this fate, and not many other decisions? It is not the reasons provided in the draft Alito opinion: The explanation for <i>Roe’</i>s demise is to be found not in law, per se, but in the court’s entanglement in our pernicious moment of <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/the-hyper-polarization-of-america/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;partisan hyperpolarization&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/the-hyper-polarization-of-america/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22af0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22af0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">partisan hyperpolarization</a> and the Republican Party’s inextricable link to anti-abortion politics.</p>
<p>Chief Justice John Roberts has acknowledged the document is authentic, and its style certainly suggests it is indeed by Alito. So, how does his rationale for overturning <i>Roe</i> stack up as a justification for a large, and likely convulsive, change in American society? The reasons flagged by the draft opinion fall painfully short. In fact, their profound weakness highlights precisely why <i>Roe</i> and abortion rights have been singled out. Go down the list of contentious legal questions, and it quickly becomes clear that conservatives do not follow Alito’s approach anywhere else besides <i>Roe</i>.</p>
<p>For instance, the draft majority opinion spills a good deal of ink on the history of abortion regulation in England and the United States (skimming over, as it does it, the considerable periods in which abortion was left to the free choice of women). But precisely this kind of appeal to a history of close regulation can be made in respect to the Second Amendment right to bear arms. As the legal scholars <a href="https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/illlr116&amp;div=8&amp;id=&amp;page=" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Reva Siegel and Joseph Blocher documented&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/illlr116&amp;div=8&amp;id=&amp;page=&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22af0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22af0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Reva Siegel and Joseph Blocher documented</a> in extensive detail, there is a “centuries” old tradition of common law rules regulating weapons, especially when they are carried into the public sphere. This has not stopped the conservative justices from creating a novel individual right to bear arms and extending that right against both the federal and the state governments.</p>
<p>Next, the Alito opinion spends a good deal of energy shellacking the reasoning of Justice Harry Blackmun’s 1972 opinion in <i>Roe v. Wade</i>. The opinion, says Alito, is “hard to defend” and “egregiously wrong.” But by the very standards that Alito himself brings to bear, there are many opinions that are so “egregiously wrong” that they should be chucked out. And yet they awake nary a peek from our most conservative of courts.</p>
<p>To see this, it is helpful to see why Alito says <i>Roe</i> is wrong. The core of Alito’s argument is the idea that the <i>Roe</i> Court defined the “liberty” protected by the 14th Amendment at too high, and too abstract, a level of generality. It is, in other words, unanchored from the text of the Constitution. But let’s say we took seriously the idea that the court should avoid readings of the Constitution pitched at too high a level of generality, and not anchored in the text of the Constitution. What else would have to go?<br></p>
<br>
<p>The first thing to go would be the Roberts Court’s rulings on the so-called removal power of the president to oust agency heads, which has been used to attack the regulatory state. Next to go would be the court’s rulings that an ambient, unwritten principle of “state sovereign immunity” precludes all sorts of damages claims against the federal government. This despite the fact no such principle is mentioned in the Constitution. Ironically, Alito himself authored <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2011/10-1024" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1651598672694,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017b-546f-d449-a17f-df7fd6960000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1651598672694,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017b-546f-d449-a17f-df7fd6960000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.oyez.org/cases/2011/10-1024&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-8af3-dd36-a38c-cfffbc070001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;one such opinion&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-8af3-dd36-a38c-cfffbc070000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">one such opinion</a> almost exactly a decade ago. And third, consider all of the court’s campaign finance opinions: They interpret the word “speech” in the First Amendment at a highly abstract level to sweep in not just speaking but spending — a sleight of hand that would have seemed absurd in 1791.</p>
<p>Is the Supreme Court about to throw out its campaign finance jurisprudence, its special solicitude for the government’s purse, or raw presidential power? Don’t get your hopes up.</p>
<p>There’s more, but it’s embarrassing in its meagerness. Abortion, Alito says by way of example, is just <i>different</i> from other fundamental rights — including the right to marry and the right against involuntary sterilization — because it raises a “critical moral question.” The suggestion here is that miscegenation laws and state eugenics programs raise no “critical” moral issue. This is worse than absurd; it’s morally obscene.</p>
<p>The reasons Alito himself gives, in short, for singling out <i>Roe</i> cannot explain the decision to overrule that case. All apply equally to opinions that Alito and colleagues have embraced and enforced with vigor.<br></p>
<br>
<p>So what then is going on? The answer is embarrassingly clear. When Alito cautions against the injection of the justices’ own “ardent views” into the law, he skips over a fateful step. The problem with <i>Roe</i> and the draft <i>Dobbs</i> opinion alike is not that they are tainted with the tincture of the justices’ own views. Of course they are: Just notice Alito’s loaded pejorative talk of “abortionists” if you were doubtful on this score.</p>
<p>No, the problem is that the sole explanation for the disparate anger and disdain targeted at <i>Roe</i> is that that right to abortion has been the ardent target of key factions within the Republican Party for years. And the untimely death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg allowed former President Donald Trump to deploy judicial appointments to deliver <i>Roe’</i>s execution notice in late 2020. When <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/01/sotomayor-supreme-court-liberals-sound-alarm-in-fight-to-overturn-roe-v-wade.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Justice Sonia Sotomayor pointed this out&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/01/sotomayor-supreme-court-liberals-sound-alarm-in-fight-to-overturn-roe-v-wade.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22af0006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22af0007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Justice Sonia Sotomayor pointed this out</a> at oral argument in <i>Dobbs</i>, she was only stating what every single participant in the confirmation battles of the last several years well understood, and only the willfully blind could deny.</p>
<p>Indeed, what is striking about the modern Supreme Court is not so much that its members have “ardent views” but that those views reflect the immediate priorities of the Republican Party. Abortion, of course, is central to key religious elements of the Republican coalition, and thus an election issue of singular importance. But to make my point, a non-abortion example may be helpful: Until the Obama presidency, there was broad agreement among both liberal and conservative justices over the idea that courts should generally give federal regulatory agencies a great deal of leeway. But in 2016, the Republican National Committee included in its platform item <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjXkoSMusL3AhWZX80KHXd-CWoQFnoECAgQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fprod-cdn-static.gop.com%2Fmedia%2Fdocuments%2FDRAFT_12_FINAL%255B1%255D-ben_1468872234.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw0ZlBtj2Rrovr9mA9DZJCOy" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;an attack on such deference&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjXkoSMusL3AhWZX80KHXd-CWoQFnoECAgQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fprod-cdn-static.gop.com%2Fmedia%2Fdocuments%2FDRAFT_12_FINAL%255B1%255D-ben_1468872234.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw0ZlBtj2Rrovr9mA9DZJCOy&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22af0008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22af0009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">an attack on such deference</a>.

On this issue, as on abortion, the arguments professed as law have nakedly partisan origins.</p>
<p>The tight linkage between the Republican Party and the conservative faction of the Court is not distinctive to these issues. But it is without precedent in recent American history. Political elites have long sought to appoint fellow travelers to the bench. But the present moment is fundamentally different because of the extraordinary combination of once-in-a-century partisan polarization with the unprecedented growth of an ecosystem of Republican interest groups and academics that have the justices’ ear.</p>
<p>Ironically, one of the reasons that Alito gives for killing <i>Roe</i> is that it had “damaging consequences.” Although the reader is left to guess what Alito thinks he’s talking about here, the very same can and will be said of this <i>Dobbs</i> opinion: It will serve as a proof text that this is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/09/15/the-roberts-court-is-dying-heres-what-comes-next-511784" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;no longer the Roberts Court&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/09/15/the-roberts-court-is-dying-heres-what-comes-next-511784&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22af000c&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22af000d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">no longer the Roberts Court</a>; it serves quite another master.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>By now, Americans will have awakened to the disclosure of a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;draft Supreme Court opinion&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22b10003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22b10004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">draft Supreme Court opinion</a> by Justice Samuel Alito that erases <i>Roe v. Wade</i> and <i>Casey v. Planned Parenthood</i> from the Court’s jurisprudence — and with them, a pregnant person’s constitutional right to reproductive autonomy. There are reports that Chief Justice John Roberts initially voted against overruling precedent but wanted to find a way to uphold the Mississippi law at the heart of the case, which bans abortion after 15 weeks, and now plans to dissent.</p>
<p>Beyond what Alito’s draft opinion in <i>Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization</i> portends for the future of abortion rights is the striking method of analysis he employs in the reported draft. Despite his many efforts to reassure that the opinion “does not undermine” other constitutional rights “in any way,” it actually outlines a roadmap for the withdrawal of other cherished constitutional rights.</p>
<p>We should not take Alito at his word that the court might go no further after eliminating abortion rights, and a careful reading of his draft suggests a number of reasons to be concerned the current court could target other rights.</p>
<p>First, we should always take with a grain of salt what judges say in trying to contain what other judges might say in the future. Just as Alito and several other justices felt no need to stick with a precedent that has been on the books for nearly 50 years, there is nothing in the <i>Dobbs</i> draft that binds future justices according to the fine distinction Alito draws when he says that “what sharply distinguishes the abortion right from the rights recognized in the cases on which <i>Roe</i> and <i>Casey</i> rely” is “the critical moral question posed by abortion.” Many other rights, too, pose difficult moral questions, such as a parent’s right to educate a child, the proper place for religion in the public square or the rights of sexual minorities.</p>
<p>Alito suggests that the fact that many Americans see abortion as the destruction of potential life marks the dividing line between the right to abortion and other rights, but it’s not the only place where one might draw the line between morally fraught matters. Five justices could easily say later that other rights are morally difficult and should be returned entirely to the vagaries of legislative politics.<br></p>
<br><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6305570233112" frameborder="0"></iframe> 
<br>
<p>Second, Alito’s method of analysis in <i>Dobbs&nbsp;</i>doesn’t just overrule abortion precedent, it treats precedent generally as a paper barrier to a narrow reading of constitutional text and tradition, something that can be swept aside whenever five justices believe that a past decision is wrongly decided. Alito spends time explaining why the <i>Casey</i> court erred by not overruling <i>Roe</i> (which he calls “egregiously wrong and deeply damaging”) when it had the opportunity to do so back in 1992. Along the way, he maligns Justice Harry Blackmun, the author of <i>Roe</i>, and everyone who subsequently voted to uphold that precedent, for approving something “far outside the bounds of any reasonable interpretation” of the Constitution. (He also calls <i>Roe</i> an “abuse of judicial authority.”)</p>
<p>Relatedly, the <i>Casey</i> plurality had concluded that it would affirm <i>Roe</i> in part because millions of Americans had since 1973 relied upon that precedent to order their lives. In his draft opinion in <i>Dobbs</i>, Alito merely shrugged at that key point and observed, “that form of reliance depends on an empirical question that is hard for anyone — and in particular, for a court — to assess.” In other words, the fact that ordinary citizens have found a right to be valuable will not stop an emboldened conservative court in overruling precedent and erasing a constitutional right in the future.</p>
<p>Third, the actual methodology Alito employs to say that no constitutional right to reproductive autonomy exists would imperil other judicially recognized rights. He writes that “[t]he Constitution makes no reference to abortion,” and then limits any rights not specifically mentioned in the Constitution to those “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition.”</p>
<p>Alito’s text-narrowed-by-tradition approach — if applied consistently — would seem to eliminate other rights that aren’t explicitly listed in the Bill of Rights, including the right to birth control and same-sex marriage. After all, neither marriage nor contraception is mentioned in the Constitution, and it’s exceedingly unlikely that a legal test that hews so closely to tradition would yield the answer that birth control or same-sex marriage was deeply rooted by the time of the 14th Amendment’s ratification in the late 19th century. This narrow method of understanding individual liberty authorizes a return to traditionalist, and perhaps even sectarian, modes of analysis — it all depends on how five justices understand our nation’s sense of “ordered liberty.” And laws once outlawed the use of birth control and same-sex marriage — Alito’s justification for denying that the right to reproductive autonomy is deeply rooted in tradition.</p>
<p>It would also almost certainly spell the end to any approach that takes account of broader societal or legal developments when deciding what is “constitutional.” Over the course of American history, mobilized citizens have achieved meaningful shifts in the meaning of “liberty” and “equality” — an important source of adaptations in our legal order, particularly when it is so hard to formally amend the Constitution. The court has, in the past, taken these shifts into account: One example of this type of text-and-principle approach can be found in decisions authored by Justice Anthony Kennedy, who had explicitly incorporated legal and political developments in <i>Lawrence</i> and <i>Obergefell&nbsp;</i>when he determined the scope of the 14th Amendment. But Alito’s draft would slam the door on that sort of rights jurisprudence.</p>
<p>To the contrary, he deems any approach to interpret the Constitution as a living document “controversial,” even after all these years. Indeed, Alito’s draft takes potshots at a variety of rulings in which other rights were vindicated. It’s telling that Alito calls <i>Roe</i>’s invocation of a right to privacy “remarkably loose in its treatment of the constitutional text” and “unfocused analysis.” But <i>Roe</i> largely relied on <i>Griswold v. Connecticut</i>, which established a right to privacy to use contraception by drawing together different provisions and cases that, in one form or another, protected some sphere of privacy or liberty. The same accusation Alito levels against <i>Roe</i> can also be made about <i>Griswold</i>, and nothing Alito says in <i>Dobbs</i> limits his hostility to this kind of structural analysis to abortion.</p>
<p>At a later point in the draft, Alito pokes fun at Kennedy’s language in <i>Casey</i> and <i>Lawrence v. Texas</i>, which established a right to sexual intimacy regardless of one’s sexual orientation. “While individuals are certainly free to think and to say what they wish about ‘existence,’ ‘meaning,’ the ‘universe,’ and ‘the mystery of human life,’ they are not always free to act in accordance with those thoughts.” But this is more than just a gratuitous effort to ridicule; Alito is not so subtly denying legitimacy to decisions that encompass a progressive conception of liberty. Kennedy had grounded <i>Casey</i>, <i>Lawrence</i> and <i>Obergefell</i> (establishing a right to same-sex marriage) on such a reading of the 14th Amendment. Alito’s approach can be used to unwind these decisions too.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s much that could still change before the Supreme Court issues an official decision in <i>Dobbs</i>, replete with any concurring and dissenting opinions. Votes could still change, and there are often some modifications to an opinion as it is circulated and discussed by the justices, so some of this language could still be softened or eliminated. But if most of Alito’s draft remains intact, Americans should be prepared not just to see <i>Roe v. Wade</i> obliterated — but also other constitutional rights put up for grabs. Once rights are rolled back, as Alito’s opinion upholding Mississippi’s law reminds us, the state needs only to assert moral reasons to criminalize behavior it wishes to discourage. Eliminating a landmark decision is like cutting a hole in a tapestry, and we don’t know yet how much of constitutional law will unravel.</p>
<p>If there is one precedent that Alito’s opinion respects, and indeed doubles down on, it is the 1997 decision authored by former Chief Justice William Rehnquist: <i>Washington v. Glucksberg</i>. There, the court used the text-and-tradition approach to reject a constitutional right to die. The fact that the Constitution did not spell out such a right clearly, coupled with the existence of laws on the books banning suicide, was enough to stop an individual’s assertion of a right to assisted suicide in its tracks. Alito’s draft <i>Dobbs</i> opinion repeatedly invokes <i>Glucksberg</i>, reviving a methodology that puts much of individual rights analysis at the mercy of the state by making whether a right exists largely coterminous with past exercises of state power.</p>
<p>Again, the fact that states once criminalized a sphere of activity seemingly ends the analysis before it begins. What 19th century Americans reasonably believed “liberty” or “equality” meant (an approach that might involve resorting to original public meaning), or what citizens believe such terms mean today (a pure textual approach or living constitutional approach), would be wholly irrelevant to what federal judges may decide.</p>
<p>Alito’s reliance on <i>Glucksberg</i> is noteworthy for another reason. The only justice remaining in the 5-4 majority that issued that decision still on the court is Justice Clarence Thomas. As the most senior member of the apparent majority in <i>Dobbs</i>, Thomas would have the power to assign someone to write <i>Dobbs</i>. Giving it to Alito to deal the final blow to <i>Roe</i> rather than another colleague would not just raise the odds that their coalition doesn’t fall apart, but also ensures that the opinion would adopt the methodology most hostile to modern rights jurisprudence — and give the Court the most leeway to roll back other rights we have come to rely on.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Well, in “deja vu all over again” news, Washington’s movers and shakers were rubbing egos again this past weekend, the Kardashians are back in court and a new poll tells us that Americans are chomping at the bit for their chance to vote for a third party — provided you not squint too closely.</p>
<p>The question from the Harvard/Harris poll: “Do you think that you would consider a moderate independent candidate for president if the 2024 match was between Donald Trump and Joe Biden?”</p>
<p>Now, “consider” is a lot less binding an opinion than “can we vote today?” Still, 58 percent of respondents said yes, a pretty hefty majority for a question that asks voters if they’re prepared to overturn 160 years of history and send a third party to the White House. Nancy Jacobson, the CEO and founder of the centrist advocacy group “No Labels,” <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/3463872-the-2024-surprise-few-can-see-coming/?rl=1" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1651523953341,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-1f77-dc58-a78d-3fffa1f10000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1651523953341,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-1f77-dc58-a78d-3fffa1f10000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/3463872-the-2024-surprise-few-can-see-coming/?rl=1&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-867f-d337-a9cc-beff8ca30001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;seized on the poll&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-867f-d337-a9cc-beff8ca30000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">seized on the poll</a> as evidence that a moderate independent contender could actually win this time: “2024 may prove to be a whole different ballgame.” (Could that be what’s on the mind of Andrew Yang, the former Democratic presidential candidate and New York City mayoral contender, who created the Forward Party last fall?)</p>
<p>It's true that a Biden-Trump rematch would produce many a grimace; neither man is particularly popular (nor particularly young). But the fact is, the attraction of “neither of the above” has been a constant, if limited, feature of American political life for more than a century. Last year, when Gallup asked a similar question in the pre-inflation, pre-Ukraine, pre-immigration surge, pre-we’re-going-to-Hell-in-an-express-elevator atmosphere, 62 percent of U.S. adults said the “parties do such a poor job representing the American people that a third party is needed.” Yet whenever the public is actually given the chance to choose a different path, it ultimately demurs (apart from the modest amount of people who effectively throw away their ballot). And there’s no reason to think 2024 will be different.<br></p>
<br>
<p>Thirty years ago, a quirky character out of Texas with a million quips and several billion dollars actually won 19 percent of the vote in a general election; until Ross Perot’s sudden and temporary departure from the race, he was running competitively with President George Bush and Governor Bill Clinton. A decade earlier, in the late spring of 1980, Republican-turned-independent John Anderson was essentially even with President Jimmy Carter and Governor Ronald Reagan, before winding up with 7 percent of the vote. In 1948 and 1968, two segregationists — South Carolina Governor Strom Thurmond and Alabama Governor George Wallace — won enough electoral votes to threaten a deadlocked Electoral College but both came up short. While Calvin Coolidge was gliding to a landslide in 1924, progressive Sen. Bob LaFollette was winning his home state of Wisconsin, along with 16.6 percent of the national popular vote. Sometimes a third party’s impact can be enormous; if exit polls were right, Ralph Nader voters in 2000 would have split heavily for Al Gore, netting him more than enough votes to win Florida and the White House.</p>
<p>What’s notable is how varied the source of these independent campaigns were, and how common the end result. They were by turns regional and national, ideological- and process-driven, rooted in broad disaffection and the appeal of charismatic candidates, but none came close to setting down roots in the American political system that would nurture a long-term political movement, let alone propel someone to victory. In 1912, even Theodore Roosevelt — one of the most popular presidents ever to hold the office — could not sustain a functioning Progressive Party to reclaim the White House or remain a<b>&nbsp;</b>significant power player.</p>
<p>No other free nation has stuck so firmly to its dominant two parties than the United States. A century ago, Britain’s Labour Party replaced the Liberal Party as one of the two dominant parties, and newer entries like the Scottish National Party hold significant power. In France, Emmanuel Macron’s party did not exist a decade ago, while the two dominant French parties of the previous era are now pathetic shadows of their old selves. (The socialist party won less than 2 percent of the vote.) Yet here in the United States, whose founders deplored the idea of political “factions,” the two-party system endures with the same two parties that have existed since the 19th century.</p>
<p>They endure even though two of the principal obstacles to competing parties have been essentially removed. Ballot access laws used to make third parties battle Parris Island obstacle courses. Then, after Perot’s lawyers entered the fray, the obstacles were essentially cleared away. (In fact, it became so easy for minor party candidates to get on the Florida ballot that in 2000, a Palm Beach County election official came up with a new design to make sure the names on the ballot were readable. The “butterfly” ballot may jog a memory or two…)</p>
<p>The other obstacle — money — is essentially yesterday’s news.<b>&nbsp;</b>From<b>&nbsp;</b>the ability of billionaires to give themselves unlimited aid to the flood of dark, beige, and “clean” money empowered by <i>Citizens United</i> to the power of the Internet, finances no longer stand in the way of a mass movement getting its voice heard.</p>
<p>The fundamental hurdle to third parties here, rather, are structural. We elect our presidents through a mechanism — the Electoral College — that ensures that even a nationally popular party or figure can wind up with no voice whatsoever. Strom Thurmond got 2 percent of the popular vote in 1948, but because it was regionally concentrated, he won 39 electoral votes. Perot got 19 percent of the national vote in 1992, and not a single electoral vote. (Back in 2007, when he was considering an independent run for the White House, New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg told me, “I could spend half a billion dollars, and the most I could achieve is to deadlock the Electoral College.” Instead, he spent more than $1 billon to run as a Democrat in 2020 and only won American Samoa.)</p>
<p>Moreover, we do not have a parliamentary system. When Perot was campaigning on the then-horrific $3 trillion federal debt, there was no “Balanced Budget” party to run on this issue across the country. By contrast, when environmentalists in Germany felt their voice was unheeded, they formed a Green Party, which won 15 percent of the vote last year and which is often a significant player in coalition governments. The only impact of Perot’s remarkable run — and it was significant — was to force Clinton to address the budget deficit. That’s how it’s been throughout the history of the United States: A third party’s popular stance gets absorbed by one of the major parties and the independent movement withers away.<br></p>
<br>
<p>What makes this picture even gloomier for advocates of more political choices is the impact of polarization. Today, unlike in times past, the most reliable predictor of a presidential vote is the party of the voter. This may seem obvious, but it has only been recently true. In the tight election of 1976, 11 percent of Republicans voted for Jimmy Carter and 20 percent of Democrats voted for Gerald Ford. In 2020, 94 percent of Democrats voted for Biden; 94 percent of Republicans voted for Trump. In this climate — where large factions of party members regard the other party as not just wrong, but evil — the idea of a new entity drawing discontented voters from the center of both parties seems a heavy reach.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for possible good news about an alternative to the two parties, there are some structural reforms already in place that might help. The newer primary rules in states like California and Alaska, where the two or four survivors of a first-round primary advance to November regardless of party; the “ranked choice” voting system that makes a voter’s second choice potentially decisive — these may give life to an old hunger that has never been fully fed since John Charles Fremont ran for president in 1856 on the new Republican Party. But do not let the latest polls mislead you. The distance between the abstract appeal of a new voice and the reality of a viable new party or independent candidate is immense.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>“I feel deeply ashamed,” my friend said. The hallway was narrow. The ceiling was low. The line was meandering toward the door to the ballroom, carrying 2,600 revelers and an unknown number of viral spores into a windowless space crammed with tables and chairs and, eventually, the president of the United States.</p>
<p>We were all, per the rules, multiply vaxxed and freshly tested. We’d been obliged to upload the test results and the vaccine cards on to an app, which would then generate an entry pass to be presented at the door. But some people were having trouble with the app, which led to bottlenecks in the line. The milling in close quarters, even with the precautions, stirred a familiar Covid-era unease. And my friend’s shame.<br></p>
<br>
<p>It felt, come to think of it, like the opening of a 1970s disaster movie — the ball-gowned, tuxedo-clad swells ignoring the ominous stats, heedless of the recent history that gets dispensed with before the opening credits: A superspreader event at the Gridiron dinner. The vice president, stricken with the virus. Even Anthony Fauci dropped out. Yet here we were, reviving an old ritual that had recently lain dormant. Until tonight. We deserved our fate.</p>
<p>And a lot of the crowd, I suspect, thought it was worth it.<br></p>
<br><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6305481294112" frameborder="0"></iframe> 
<br>
<p>The annual White House Correspondents’ Association dinner is one of the great spectacles of the capital’s culture. But despite the C-SPAN broadcast, it’s more like community pageantry than a real stage show, which means a review of the evening needs to include the audience as much as the official performers. On this night, the state of that audience was, ultimately, a bit like the state of our union in this year of incomplete recovery and complete frustration: one part gallows-humor fatalism, one part determination to proceed, one part thrill at getting to be in the company of so many fellow human beings again.</p>
<p>Before dinner, there were jokes about clothes that stopped fitting during the pandemic. People copped to being rusty — so many months without the kind of small talk you make while peering over your interlocutor’s shoulder to watch Glenn Youngkin bro-hug Steve Case. But in Washington, working a room is a widely held skill, and it turns out to be a bit like riding a bike. It didn’t take long for the muscle memory to kick in. There were several announcements before dinner urging everyone to take their seats so that the program could begin.</p>
<p>I suspect the two-year Covid-induced WHCA drought also made the audience easier to please. One of the dreariest aspects of official Washington banqueting is the ostentatiously smarmy displays of troop-respecting. Do we really need an honor guard and a national anthem rendition for a <i>dinner</i>? But this year, in a divided country, a bit of saccharine patriotism felt quite refreshing. I heard a few people singing along with “The Star-Spangled Banner.” Then, alas, I thought of Covid again.</p>
<p>And while the traditional cringey celebrity guests were either relatively dated (Drew Barrymore, Harry Hamlin) or just baffling (Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson!) cell phone pictures and selfies were still being snapped. When was the last time <i>you</i> saw a celeb?</p>
<p>But even if it was a crowd predisposed to cheer, the show was actually pretty good! The yuks portion of the night got rolling with a video montage of James Corden trying to do the job of White House spokesperson and Billy Eichner giving awards to entertainment journalists.</p>
<p>Then President Joe Biden took the stage, working with pretty good material. Naturally there were zingers about Fox (he noted that everyone in the room had to show their vaccination status, meaning Sean Hannity and the various other network notables in attendance were vax icons) and Donald Trump (“We had a horrible plague followed by two years of Covid”). Biden did manage, alas, to step on his best joke (it was supposed to be about how it would have been a “real coup” if the WHCA had managed to engage Trump as a speaker). And the only groaners were the self-deprecating ones: Biden needs to find something other than his age and his low approval numbers to riff on.</p>
<p>Still, the way to win over a room full of journalists isn’t by sticking with good topical humor. We’re a sentimental tribe, and, as such, are going to respond well when Biden breaks out his twinkly Irish incarnation and whispers and goes purple about the hallowed nature of reporting. A free press “is not the enemy of the people” he said. “I mean this in the bottom of my heart, that you — the free press — matter more than you ever did in the last century."</p>
<p>Unlike the presidential speech, the professional comedian portion of the dinner has a fraught history. Over the years, there’s been pearl-clutching about routines that were allegedly too cutting (Stephen Colbert with George W. Bush, Wanda Sykes with Barack Obama), which usually leads to an overcorrection the following year: The gentle celebrity-impression guy Rich Little was booked the year after Colbert skewered Bush. The last pre-Covid dinner was the apotheosis of this tendency: The association got rid of the comedian following a backlash over Michelle Wolf’s swipes at Trump spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders, opting to have biographer Ron Chernow give historical remarks instead. With comedy back on the menu in 2022, where along this spectrum would Trevor Noah land?</p>
<p>As it turned out, he landed in a good spot. Noah is not a comedian who mines laughs out of uncomfortable situations — the sort of stuff that usually causes trouble for comedians sharing a stage with politicians. Instead, he’s able to be a zinger guy, which is more or less the game he brought. On stage, he took some shots at Biden, who appeared to have practiced his laughing-at-myself face, tossing his head back and grinning. But there were also shots at Trump, Ron DeSantis and Kyrsten Sinema, among other political figures. And smartly, most of the shots were at the one thing most reporters like discussing more than politics: ourselves. Among other media targets, there were gibes about Fox and MSNBC, copious laughs at the expense of CNN, and a kidney punch of a bit about Chuck Todd not knowing how to ask follow-up questions. He knew the audience well: The list of name checks included such unlikely figures as Washington Post fact checker Glenn Kessler, the kind of reference that may not play so well outside the confines of the Washington Hilton.</p>
<p>Noah, too, knew that you gotta bring the riff home by going noble about the mission of journalism, closing with a keep-it-real paean to the Fourth Estate. It killed. For at least a minute. And then, even before the schmoozing president left the dais, people were up from their tables and working the room. It was time to figure out which after-party to hit. It may have been, as Noah said, “the nation’s most distinguished superspreader event,” but any positive tests wouldn’t start rolling in for 48 hours.</p>
<p>The disaster movie sequence could wait a bit.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<br>
<p>In a non-descript room in a secret police station deep within a sprawling Moscow exhibition center, a Russian police officer offered Marina Ovsyannikova a cup of tea.<br></p>
<br>
<p>“For some reason, I wasn’t afraid,” Ovsyannikova told me over the phone a few days ago. “In that moment I wasn’t afraid. Now — I would think twice.”</p>
<p>By that point, Ovsyannikova, a 43-year-old editor from Russia’s state-run propagandist Channel One TV network had already answered the same questions for hours; she was tired, hungry and thirsty. The previous night, on March 14 at 9:30 p.m., she had crashed the set of Russia’s top evening newscast Vremya wearing a necklace in the colors of the Ukrainian and Russian flags and brandishing an anti-war poster. “Stop the war. Don’t believe the propaganda. They are lying to you here,” she had written in Russian. “No war” and “Russians against war,” she’d scrawled in English. “Stop the war, no to war, stop the war, no to war,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSWg5lnGUVM" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;she shouted&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSWg5lnGUVM&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22bd0006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22bd0007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">she shouted</a>.<br></p>
<br>
<p>For a few moments, Ovsyannikova’s protest was beamed into homes around Moscow and central Russia. Then, the camera cut away. Ovsyannikova was detained, taken to a large police station within the state television studio complex known as Ostankino, before being moved half a mile to the secret police department within Moscow’s Exhibition of Achievements of National Economy, a large park with exhibition halls known by its acronym VDNKh, where she was held for the next 14 hours.</p>
<p>It was after what seemed like endless questioning, in the wee hours of the morning, that her interrogator said: “Let’s drink a cup of tea. Let’s eat some blini. Everyone’s hungry,” Ovsyannikova recounted.</p>
<p>As any foe of Russian President Vladimir Putin would have warned Ovsyannikova, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/toxic-tea-multiple-russians-hit-by-suspected-poisonings/2020/08/20/34f589be-e2e6-11ea-82d8-5e55d47e90ca_story.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;were they still alive to do so&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/toxic-tea-multiple-russians-hit-by-suspected-poisonings/2020/08/20/34f589be-e2e6-11ea-82d8-5e55d47e90ca_story.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22bd0009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22bd000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">were they still alive to do so</a>: When a Russian security officer offers you an Earl Grey and a snack, don’t say yes. But Ovsyannikova was new to the dissident game and unprepared for what lay ahead of her.</p>
<p>She drank the tea.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center">Saved by Macron</h3>
<br>
<img src="https://static.politico.com/96/88/2be66e1041bf8afd2ecfeabdb201/mag.Marina.Secondary.statue.jpg">
<br>
<p><b>Most visitors to</b> the VDNKh complex, located half a mile from the Ostankino television and radio tower, are greeted by an iconic 78-foot-high statue of the “<a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/worker-and-kolkhoz-woman" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Worker and Kolkhoz Woman&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/worker-and-kolkhoz-woman&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22bd000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22bd000c&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Worker and Kolkhoz Woman</a>” and other Soviet-era relics.</p>
<p>But Ovsyannikova got to admire VDNKh’s true Stalinist legacy, buried deep within its walls.</p>
<p>“All the journalists were looking for me, all the lawyers. They were looking for me in Ostankino, where there’s a large police department. But the fact that there’s a police department at the exhibition center — no journalists knew about that. It’s a secret department, a small police station, and that’s where they took me.”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t the dungeons of Lubyanka,” she said, referring to the feared headquarters of the Federal Security Service (FSB) of the Russian Federation, the successor to the Soviet Union's KGB. “There weren’t any handcuffs, they didn’t torture me.”</p>
<p>Still, her interrogators weren’t messing around.</p>
<p>“They didn’t leave me alone for a second. If someone had to leave the room, a different person came in and was with me the whole time. I didn’t know, I’ve never been interrogated, so I asked, ‘Why are you following me even to the toilet?’”</p>
<p>Ovsyannikova was mainly interrogated by two men, she told me in our conversation — one taking the lead, the other helping out. Both were in their mid-30s, neither particularly imposing, and she had the feeling they were lackeys carrying out someone else’s bidding.</p>
<p>“This was not some kind of skillful interrogator from Lubyanka who is super intelligent, who is immersed in the political world," she said. The main inquisitor was “such an ordinary average Joe.”</p>
<p>As the men questioned her, their phones kept ringing. Ovsyannikov could hear them talk with their higher-ups, who told them how the world was responding to Ovsyannikova’s protest and subsequent disappearance as they debated what kind of charges to bring against her.</p>
<p>“The situation was constantly changing. … The interrogator was saying, ‘Oh, will this be administrative charges? No, it’s criminal, we’ll put you in jail,’” Ovsyannikova said. “They were watching for my reaction, and for the reactions from the international community.”</p>
<p>The first big moment came when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked Ovsyannikova for her protest in his <a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/vidpovidalnist-za-voyenni-zlochini-dlya-rosijskih-vijskovih-73561" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;nightly address&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/vidpovidalnist-za-voyenni-zlochini-dlya-rosijskih-vijskovih-73561&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22be0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22be0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">nightly address</a> just after 2 a.m. — saying he was grateful “specifically to the lady who entered the studio of Channel One with a poster against the war."<br></p>

<br>
<p>But the real breakthrough came later that morning, when French President Emmanuel Macron expressed concern over Ovsyannikova’s whereabouts, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/russia-ukraine-latest-news-2022-03-15/card/france-s-macron-offers-asylum-to-woman-who-interrupted-russian-broadcast-BA3djX0sOFoUyzEOXqfC" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1651359283913,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-5abe-d1fc-ad7f-fefe76ec0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1651359283913,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-5abe-d1fc-ad7f-fefe76ec0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/russia-ukraine-latest-news-2022-03-15/card/france-s-macron-offers-asylum-to-woman-who-interrupted-russian-broadcast-BA3djX0sOFoUyzEOXqfC&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-7cae-d337-a9cc-feaef22d0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;telling reporters&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-7cae-d337-a9cc-feaef22d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">telling reporters</a>: “We are obviously taking steps aimed at offering your colleague our protection at the embassy or an asylum protection.”</p>
<p>As soon as Macron made those comments, the interrogator’s phone rang with instructions to impose administrative charges, carrying a maximum sentence of only 10 days, rather than criminal ones, which could have seen her imprisoned for up to 15 years.</p>
<p>“I could hear part of the conversation,” Ovsyannikova told me. “I understood they were getting calls from higher management, and they were given some additional questions. Clearly, they were told what to ask me. And then the investigator was joking, ‘Oh, now Macron is calling you, something is going to change.’”</p>
<p>“It’s possible that Macron with his very fast reaction and offer of political asylum — it’s possible that saved me from criminal charges,” she said.</p>
<p>But escaping criminal charges turned out to be a different kind of punishment.<br></p>

<br>
<h3 style="text-align: center">Dissident or Stooge?</h3>
<p><b>To many Russians</b> and Russia-watchers, it all seems so unlikely.</p>
<p>The incongruities in the story of Marina O. are mind-boggling: A veteran propagandist straight out of central casting suddenly grows a conscience and blows up her comfortable life by speaking out against a regime she spent two decades propping up. The fact she was able to burst onto the set of Vremya, Russia’s showcase evening news program, and made it to air without being dragged off by guards or dumped by a censor. The decision by authorities to give her only an administrative punishment relating to an anti-war video she posted on social media, rather than pursue criminal charges for the TV protest itself. Her lenient fine of 30,000 rubles (at that time, around $280), rather than the threatened 15-year prison sentence. The fact she was subsequently freed and free to speak with Western media.</p>
<p>And then, a month later, she had a new job as a contributing writer at Germany’s Die Welt newspaper (which is owned by POLITICO’s parent company, Axel Springer); Die Welt editors offered me an interview with her on the condition that I not disclose her whereabouts, certain facts about her family situation or her plans for the future. I am allowed to say that when we spoke, she was not in Russia.</p>
<p>What I wanted to know about her was the same question everyone who’d seen her protest seemed to be asking: Is Ovsyannikova a dissident — or a Kremlin stooge?</p>
<p>After Die Welt announced it had hired Ovsyannikova, a Ukrainian youth organization called Vitsche Berlin protested outside the newspaper’s office. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CcYJIICoFvb/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1651359477126,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-5abe-d1fc-ad7f-fefe76ec0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1651359477126,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-5abe-d1fc-ad7f-fefe76ec0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/CcYJIICoFvb/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-7cb1-d7d2-adbc-7eb3e3e20000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;In a statement&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-7cb1-d7d2-adbc-7eb3e3e10000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">In a statement</a>, the activists said they were opposed to Ovsyannikova’s appointment because, “It is impossible to check whether Marina Ovsyannikova has stopped cooperating with Russia.”</p>
<p>“She paid a paltry $250 fine as punishment and was able to leave Russian territory unhindered. The Russian regime has already convicted several people of up to 10 years in prison for similar anti-war actions.”</p>
<p>“There is no such thing as ex-propaganda and no such thing as ex-propagandists,” the statement said. (Vitsche Berlin did not respond to a request for an interview.)</p>
<p>Ovsyannikova told me she understands the skeptics and wants to set the record straight.</p>
<p>On the question of why she received such a light punishment, Ovsyannikova said it was a “genius” move by the Kremlin that simultaneously took her out of the headlines and undermined her credibility.</p>
<p>“I am ready to do a polygraph, to answer any question,” she told me. “The Kremlin is pretty smart. They’ve thought it through, and they have a very good strategy: They are trying in every possible way to devalue my action, to humiliate me, to denigrate me, to cover me with dirt.”<br></p>
<br>
<img src="https://static.politico.com/6e/0b/32ffadfb48f0b10851d6a8fa7703/mag.Marina.Secondary.protest.jpg">
<br>
<p>“In Russia, they call me a British spy or a traitor,” Ovsyannikova continued. “To get Ukrainians to doubt me, they throw into the mix that I’m an agent of the FSB. … So I’m hated on one side and on the other — and for the Kremlin, that’s very useful. I think they’re probably rubbing their hands in glee right now, thinking about how great a job they’ve done resolving this problem.”</p>
<p>Of course, one of the effects of propaganda and cynical false flag operations, <a href="https://www.sandboxx.us/blog/how-false-flag-operations-work-and-russias-history-of-using-them/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;which Russia regularly conducts and accuses others of conducting&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.sandboxx.us/blog/how-false-flag-operations-work-and-russias-history-of-using-them/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22be0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22be0006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">which Russia regularly conducts and accuses others of conducting</a>, is that it becomes very difficult to believe anything is genuine. The point of Putin’s propaganda machine — which Ovsyannikova herself helped build — is the ambiguity and the fear. And the result is she can get on the air waving an anti-war placard, and there will be many people who believe she had sinister motives, was a pawn in someone’s game, on someone’s payroll, or part of a Kremlin operation to demonstrate leniency to anti-war protesters at a time when thousands had been jailed for far less visible anti-war statements.</p>
<p>Given the questions swirling about Ovsyannikova’s bona fides, why did Die Welt decide to give her a job?</p>
<p>“She’s a symbol of a Russian living in cognitive dissonance — knowing the Western world but living in a system which has to collapse in order to create the freedom to live in the Western system,” says Ulf Poschardt, Die Welt’s editor-in-chief. “So I think we should be open to people who decide not to be a part of the system any more.”</p>
<p>Many Russian journalists who have risked their lives to report about corruption and other Kremlin misdeeds, in some cases for decades, bristle at the attention given to Ovsyannikova. They don’t see why she should be praised for one act of protest when they’ve been laboring for decades in danger and obscurity — and now, in many cases, in exile.</p>
<p>Die Welt editors argue that if Russia is going to have any chance at evolving in a democratic direction, it will require many Marinas still working inside its power structures to make a similar mental and political break.</p>
<p>“And you know the German history and the history in the 20th century also. We have colleagues who spent their lives being journalists in the GDR [Communist East Germany] and who became very good journalists here,” Poschardt added.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center">Inside the Information War</h3>

<br>
<p><b>For anyone confounded</b> by Ovsyannikova’s sudden conversion from Kremlin propagandist to truth-teller, it’s important to understand what she did at Channel One.</p>
<p>Since 2003, Ovsyannikova’s job was to watch Western news streams and press conferences, looking for tidbits that made the West look bad and Russia look good. As such, she was one of the few people in Russia with unfettered access to Reuters, the BBC, the Associated Press, The New York Times and POLITICO.</p>
<p>“In this search for information, the analysis of it, I was looking at the pictures, watching all the press conferences, you know, the [U.S.] State Department, the European Commission, all our officials, the U.N. Security Council,” she told me.</p>
<p>Over time, Ovsyannikova said, the gap between what those Western sources were reporting, and what Russian media like her own Channel One told their audiences, kept growing. It nagged at her. Earlier in her life, she voted for Putin. She became a journalist during what she called the “golden age” of Russian journalism, inspired by <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/2022/03/23/russian-tv-reporter-zhanna-agalakova-quit-ukraine/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Zhanna Agalakova&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/2022/03/23/russian-tv-reporter-zhanna-agalakova-quit-ukraine/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22be0007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22be0008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Zhanna Agalakova</a> (who would later become Ovsyannikova’s Channel One colleague before also quitting the station herself over its stance on Putin’s war on Ukraine), Svetlana Sorokina (who now hosts a <a href="https://tvrain.ru/teleshow/sorokina/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;weekly talk show&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://tvrain.ru/teleshow/sorokina/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22be0009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22be000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">weekly talk show</a> on under-attack independent channel TV Rain), and Alexander Nevzorov (who is <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20220422-russia-court-jails-opposition-politician-kara-murza" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;facing a criminal case&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20220422-russia-court-jails-opposition-politician-kara-murza&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22be000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22be000c&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">facing a criminal case</a> for reporting on Russia’s shelling of the Mariupol maternity hospital in Ukraine). But now her values were clashing more and more directly with what she was doing at work.</p>
<p>“I worked on the foreign desk, I saw the reaction of the other side, I saw what people said. I read the reports, for instance about [<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/dutch-prosecutor-investigation-malaysian-airlines-ukraine-missile-that-downed-mh17-originated-in-russia/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;the downing of MH17&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.eu/article/dutch-prosecutor-investigation-malaysian-airlines-ukraine-missile-that-downed-mh17-originated-in-russia/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22be000d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22be000e&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">the downing of MH17</a>].

And over the last years, it had grown so much that I became sick over it.”</p>
<p>The beginning of the end for her, Ovsyannikova says, was not the assassinations of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/05/ten-years-putin-press-kremlin-grip-russia-media-tightens" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Kremlin critics&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/05/ten-years-putin-press-kremlin-grip-russia-media-tightens&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22bf0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22bf0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Kremlin critics</a>, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2001/04/15/russian-network-seized-in-raid/e9679fb0-31cb-4b9c-b07f-204b488f40ad/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;shuttering of independent media&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2001/04/15/russian-network-seized-in-raid/e9679fb0-31cb-4b9c-b07f-204b488f40ad/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22bf0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22bf0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">shuttering of independent media</a>, or the elimination of direct <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/1056377.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;gubernatorial elections&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.rferl.org/a/1056377.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22bf0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22bf0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">gubernatorial elections</a>.

<br>
<p>“We spoke about it with such cynicism on Channel One and all other government channels,” said Ovsyannikova, who was by then a mother of <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/journalists-at-russia-s-channel-one-scared-says-marina-ovsyannikova-/6499090.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;two young children&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.voanews.com/a/journalists-at-russia-s-channel-one-scared-says-marina-ovsyannikova-/6499090.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22bf0008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22bf0009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">two young children</a> herself. “We were so cruel. … These poor children who were already en route to the U.S. and got stuck.”</p>
<p>She acknowledges her role in supporting Putin’s propaganda machine: “Now I’ve gotten to the point where I understand, with horror, the injustices that have happened in our country, how it all grew, and why we kept working for state channels and continued lying.”</p>
<p>Then, on February 24 this year, Putin declared war on Ukraine. Ovsyannikova — who is half Ukrainian and was born in the southern Ukrainian port city of Odesa but spent much of her childhood in Grozny, the capital of the breakaway Russian region of Chechnya — says something broke inside her. Chechnya was the target of two Russian wars, and they turned her into an internal refugee.</p>
<p>“From the age of seven to around 13 years old I lived in Grozny. When the war was starting in Grozny, we heard gunshots, explosions outside our windows.” She says her mother, who was raising Ovsyannikova on her own after the death of her father when she was 5 months old, was forced to leave everything behind to flee to safety.</p>
<p>Putin’s declaration of war on Ukraine “was a double trigger for me,” she said. “It’s not only that my roots are Ukrainian, my father was Ukrainian, but in addition to this in my childhood I had lived through what Ukrainian refugees are living through.”</p>
<p>At Channel One, as with the other Russian state-run TV channels (including RT, where <a href="https://meduza.io/en/feature/2022/03/21/the-cognitive-dissonance-became-unbearable" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;according to Meduza&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://meduza.io/en/feature/2022/03/21/the-cognitive-dissonance-became-unbearable&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22bf000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22bf000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">according to Meduza</a>, Ovsyannikova’s ex-husband now heads up the Spanish service), editorial direction came straight from the top.</p>
<p>“All the instructions descended from the Kremlin,” Ovsyannikova told me. “The call comes from the Kremlin to the top guy, Kirill Kleimyonov, the director of the [Channel One] news service. … Then there are these daily morning, afternoon and evening briefings, at which they discuss what we’re going to show and in what way we’re going to present it.”</p>
<p>After February 24, those instructions included directives not to call Russia’s invasion of Ukraine a war. “As soon as the war started we stopped showing any footage from international news agencies, we only took footage from the defense ministry or from our correspondents on the front lines from Donetsk and Luhansk — no other clips. We didn’t show the extent of the humanitarian catastrophe, the refugees in Poland. Though I could see it on my screen, we obviously didn’t show it.”</p>
<p>Ovsyannikova’s first instinct was to head to the streets to protest. But as she’s told several news organizations, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/marina-ovsyannikova-russia-journalist-protester-11647544898" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;her teenage son stopped her, hiding her car keys.&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/marina-ovsyannikova-russia-journalist-protester-11647544898&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22bf000c&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22bf000d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">her teenage son stopped her, hiding her car keys.</a></p>
<p>“The idea of the protest during the live broadcast was fairly spontaneous,” she told me, and came together the day before she went through with it. She made the poster and necklace and recorded a short video on Sunday, March 13. “It was such a strong emotional impulse that I knew it had to be done on Monday, because if I didn’t do it on Monday, then on Tuesday I would just resign.”</p>
<p>She smuggled her poster into the TV studio rolled up in the sleeve of her jacket. When she got into work for her shift at 2 p.m., Ovsyannikova said she used her security pass to go into the newsroom, then sat looking for an opportunity.</p>
<p>Vremya’s host, Yekaterina Andreyeva, was separated from the rest of the newsroom by glass and guarded by security. But, Ovsyannikova says, the guard was “buried in her phone, so I realized that was my chance.”</p>
<p>She added: “I was 90 percent sure that it wouldn’t work. I truthfully just did not think that it would happen so powerfully and strongly. So I didn’t really think through the consequences. A lot of my friends now are blaming me for not deleting their numbers [from my phone] because they’re having problems, they’re getting calls.”</p>
<p>Many of Ovsyannikova’s detractors have expressed doubts that Russian news is truly broadcast live. Don’t they have a delay of at least a few seconds or minutes like many Western channels do? Ovsyannikova insists that there were so many different news broadcasts at Channel One at different times of day across the country’s 11 time zones that a delay was just impractical. Since her protest, however — the first time anything of the sort has happened in Vremya’s 54-year history — Channel One has now implemented a one-minute delay. (Numerous former colleagues and <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/mar/17/facebook-posts/news-and-other-programs-are-broadcast-live-russian/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;fact-checking experts&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/mar/17/facebook-posts/news-and-other-programs-are-broadcast-live-russian/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22bf000e&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22bf000f&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">fact-checking experts</a> have backed up Ovsyannikova’s account.)</p>
<p>“On every channel, all the news was transmitted live, right up until my protest,” she said. “Now on Channel One, there’s a one-minute delay, from what I know.”</p>
<p>She added: “People ask me why some of my sign was in English. It was really intended for a foreign audience, to show that not all Russians are idiots. … There are many people who are against the war.”</p>

<br>
<p><b>In our conversation</b>, Ovsyannikova volunteered something that she’s also told other news organizations, that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/20/marina-ovsyannikova-russian-journalist-refuses-france-asylum" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;she has no plans to emigrate to the West.&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/20/marina-ovsyannikova-russian-journalist-refuses-france-asylum&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22bf0010&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22bf0011&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">she has no plans to emigrate to the West.</a></p>
<p>“Life has changed very much, of course. But I’m not inclined to emigrate. … There’s no criminal investigation into me right now, so I’m a free person, I’m a citizen of Russia.”</p>
<p>I asked whether Ovsyannikova is concerned about the danger she could face by returning to Moscow. After all, she hasn’t been prosecuted yet for her actual protest, and Russian authorities could decide to do that at any moment.</p>
<p>“They’re watching me, they’re watching every step I take,” she acknowledged. “At any moment they could bring a criminal case against me. My lawyers say, ‘You’re relaxing too soon, they could jail anyone at any moment.’”</p>
<p>I can’t help but remember that some journalists and Kremlin critics have faced fates worse than prison. I ask Ovsyannikova if she remembers Anna Politkovskaya, a Russian journalist who survived <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/09/russia.media" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;poison administered&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/09/russia.media&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22bf0013&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22bf0014&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">poison administered</a> via a cup of tea before being <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/05/ten-years-putin-press-kremlin-grip-russia-media-tightens" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;shot dead&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/05/ten-years-putin-press-kremlin-grip-russia-media-tightens&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22bf0015&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22bf0016&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">shot dead</a> in October 2006 in the elevator of her Moscow apartment building. As it happens, I interviewed Politkovskaya just five months before she was killed, when she told me, “In Russia, you can become too famous for assassination.” She’d been wrong. Ovsyannikova clearly believes fame will be a safety net for her, however.</p>
<p>“I’m not afraid for one simple reason,” Ovsyannikova told me. “A decision was made to hush up this situation as quickly as possible, so people forget as soon as possible and no one talks to me. ... Why am I doing these interviews? I’m doing these interviews so I have protection of some kind.”</p>
<p>Toward the end of our interview, I asked Ovsyannikova whether she regrets her protest.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t change anything,” she insisted. “Maybe I woke Russians up a little bit, made them think a little bit about what they’re told on TV.”</p>
<p>“I think in many [Russians] it raised doubts,” she continued. “Because it’s one thing if you’re sitting in your kitchen and discussing with your family how the Kremlin is awful because they started this terrible war, and you feel alone and afraid. But when you see you’re not alone, when someone like me shows you there are people on TV, in the heart of the information wars, who think the same way … that’s psychologically powerful.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

Not reporters, who are accustomed to government lies. Not the man in the street. Certainly not the so-called low-information voters the government would like to diaper and stuff into an escape-proof playpen.

Without stepping out on the slippery slope, that would give Biden’s people the power to find some things dangerous or objectionable.

<p>If DHS so badly needs a paperwork project, it can address a problem closer to home: set up a bureau to study and eradicate U.S. government disinformation.</p>

<br>
<p>The posts appear late at night or early in the morning, a tranche of Instagram stories relating workplace harassment, discrimination and the terrible bosses who serve on Capitol Hill. The first-person testimonials and shreds of gossip published on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dear_white_staffers/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;@dear_white_staffers&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.instagram.com/dear_white_staffers/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22d00001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">@dear_white_staffers</a> are secrets entrusted to the DMs of one man. He lives in Washington and works on the Hill. By the time his 85,700 followers see the new posts of the day, he has read hundreds of messages from strangers, screenshotting and cropping each one to preserve the sender’s anonymity.</p>
<p>On @dear_white_staffers, requests come in for “vibe checks” on various members of Congress. The vibe check is understood to be all-encompassing. It means how’s the pay? What’s the reputation of the office? How does the member of Congress treat their staffers, their interns, their drivers? Is it kindly and fairly? Or is it poorly? Once an ask is made, the crowd-sourced replies roll in via DM, and the man’s daily ritual begins again: Read, screenshot, crop, save, re-share.<br></p>
<br>
<p>The result is a rapid-fire tour of Capitol Hill, bouncing between subjects and extremes:</p>
<p><i>“You have to be a masochist to work for this office...”</i></p>
<p><i>“Cannot hype up this office enough!! Great experience, very accommodating, and staff was very nice…”</i></p>
<p><i>“Emotionally abusive, no boundaries...”</i></p>
<p><i>“Nicest person ever. Super courteous and always makes it a point to say good morning/good evening… Grade A human…”</i></p>
<p><i>“Abusive and uses people’s past traumas to bully them. Wouldn’t recommend unless you want to end up with a shrink…”</i></p>
<p><i>“He’s not mean, he’s just awkward, curt, and expects a lot of his staff...”</i></p>
<p>The Instagram account exploded in popularity early this year, breaking the code of silence around workplace conditions in politics, particularly for people of color. The unverified posts, built on current and former political aides sharing what they know and hear, have helped drive a <a href="https://www.congressionalworkersunion.org/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;union movement&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.congressionalworkersunion.org/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22d00002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22d00003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">union movement</a> on Capitol Hill and cowed legislators who historically operate with impunity.</p>
<p>“Anon pls,” the messages begin, though by now the promise of anonymity is implicit. The owner of @dear_white_staffers has kept himself a secret, too. As a rule, the man clears out his camera roll every day. He’s turned off Instagram notifications on his phone. He’s never told his friends, or his coworkers about the account. The only person in the man’s life who knows is his partner.</p>
<p>In a place like Capitol Hill, with the long hours and slanted power dynamics, with the fear of being blackballed or hurting a party or politician’s cause, the workplace culture incentivizes silence over speaking up, even for those trying to shock the place into change. The man would like to tell you who he is. But he knows it would harm his career. Operating the account, the man told me — it’s a bit like the Matrix. “You get plugged in and you’re doing this other thing. You plug out and you’re living this other life,” he said. “It would be nice to talk to others about it.”<br></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">@dear_white_staffers in your DMs</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: left"></h3>
<p>For someone who receives hundreds of messages a day — 100 to 150 if it’s “very slow,” 300 to 400 if it’s busy — the man is responsive. When I reached out to ask if he’d be willing to speak to me, he double-tapped the message, leaving a red heart to let me know he’d seen it. When I followed up, he said he’d been taking time to think about the idea and would let me know.</p>
<p>Eventually he did. And by the time I dialed the phone number he provided in a message from the @dear_white_staffers account, he seemed nervous but relieved to finally be talking.</p>
<p>“This will probably be my first and last interview,” he said.</p>
<p>The man shared his name and employment details with me, but to protect his identity, we won’t be printing them here. Over the last three months, he said, people have tried to access the account by resetting his password. Others have reported the page to Instagram in an effort to shut it down.<br></p>

<br>
<p>For reporters, stories about bad bosses are hard to do. The keeper of @dear_white_staffers enjoys the freedom of anonymity, but also the lack of accountability it carries. He hopes the page encourages Hill staffers to talk to journalists. He’s even tried to connect interested reporters with the people who message him. But he knows the platform affords space for stories that will never be substantiated, or make it to the press. The database Legistorm tracks <a href="https://www.legistorm.com/turnover/worst_bosses.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;high staff turnover&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.legistorm.com/turnover/worst_bosses.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22d00004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22d00005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">high staff turnover</a> in the Senate and the House — a list they speculatively call “Worst Bosses?” on their website — and it may be the most reliable public indicator available to journalists. When I ask what members of Congress show up most on @dear_white_staffers, the man names many of the same lawmakers on Legistorm’s list.</p>
<p>Staffers inside multiple congressional offices, where the man still goes to work every weekday, have sent him warnings via DM: Their bosses, they say, are closely watching what happens on the account. Using a list of members’ personal email accounts, the man said, he’s identified several burner accounts he believes belong to members of Congress.</p>
<p>He remembers the day when someone asked for a thread about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the most important woman in Washington. The account had reached a level of power that frightened him.</p>
<p>“I had heard from staffers in [Pelosi’s] office saying, ‘Oh, people are talking about this. Our chief of staff is calling everyone about it.’”</p>
<p>“I was like, <i>holy shit</i>. This is reaching her office. Like, this is in <i>Nancy’s office</i>.”<br></p>

<br>
<h3 style="text-align: center">@dear_white_staffers in the beginning</h3>
<p>When the man first posted on Jan. 30, 2020, he wanted to create a basic meme account. There were others like it on Capitol — <a href="https://www.instagram.com/congressional_scheduler/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;@congressional_scheduler&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.instagram.com/congressional_scheduler/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22d00006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22d00007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">@congressional_scheduler</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tired_press_secretary/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;@tired_press_secretary&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.instagram.com/tired_press_secretary/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22d00008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22d00009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">@tired_press_secretary</a> — but he didn’t see them riff on the experiences of people like him. As a person of color on the Hill, the man has been mistaken for a valet driver at events with his boss. He’s been treated by Capitol Police differently than white colleagues. He’s had coworkers make uneducated remarks.</p>
<p>“Just being a staffer of color, you start to rack up a bunch of life experiences working here,” he said. “I felt like there was a void that needed to be filled.”<br></p>
<br>
<img src="https://static.politico.com/2f/40/1a54494c48ab88056a63d92fc20e/mag.Cramer.DWS.Secondary.clownshoes.jpg">
<br>
<p>The handle he chose is a reference to “Dear White People,” the movie and adapted Netflix series following Black students at a fictional Ivy League university. His first post shows a picture of someone putting on a pair of oversized clown shoes. The caption reads, “getting ready to get off at Cap South to make less than my white male counterparts.” Thirty-three people liked it.</p>
<p>The man kept up the memes for two years until the page shifted into something new. It was a Friday night in the middle of January when he got a DM asking to “get a thread going of horror stories driving your member of Congress around.” He reposted the request to an Instagram story and wondered if anyone would respond. “And then all of a sudden I was flooded,” he said.</p>
<p>Right away, he had the instinct to share the responses.</p>
<p>“People were a little hesitant — like, ‘This is anonymous, right? Crop my name out.’” Within weeks, the account grew to 8,000 followers. “Part of the growth was an exercise in building trust between the account and the Hill staffer community,” he said. “That’s the ingredient to the success of the account.”<br></p>
<br>

<br>
<h3 style="text-align: center">@dear_white_staffers on C-SPAN</h3>
<p>By the end of January, the mission of @dear_white_staffers was clear in the man’s mind. It wouldn’t just be a place to vent. It was a collective platform, he said. “It does feel like a hive mind now,” he said. “It feels like it belongs to all of us. So we can collectively respond to issues going on in the capital, troubleshoot some questions, talk about pay raises together.”</p>
<p>The community grew to 20,000 after Jan. 31, when another anonymous Instagram page, @deuxmoi, famous for its crowd-sourced community of celebrity watchers, asked its followers what “goss” they were talking about with friends. “Political gossip,” one user replied. “The account @dear_white_staffers is exposing D.C. a la Deux Moi.” The message was reposted to @deuxmoi’s 1 million-plus followers. The two Instagram pages use similar formatting — an endless stream of re-shared anonymous DMs — though the man said he had never heard of @deuxmoi until that day in January.</p>
<p>Less than a week later, the man got a DM from Pablo Manríquez, a reporter for Latino Rebels. The @dear_white_staffers page had been sharing stories about Hill aides on food stamps, and a new effort to organize a union. Manríquez said he wanted to ask Pelosi about it at her next press conference. “I honestly didn’t think anything of it, because I’m like, ‘There’s no way he’s gonna get a question,’” the man said. “I told him he should ask about staff pay and unionizing.”<br></p>
<br>
<img src="https://static.politico.com/69/0f/722bd18d4a50b98651b625353285/mag.Cramer.DWS.Secondary.Pelosi.jpg">
<br>
<p>On the day of the press conference, the man was working in his office. C-SPAN was on low volume on a TV nearby. But it wasn’t until he checked his Instagram, where dozens of new messages were suddenly coming in, that he realized Manríquez <a href="https://www.latinorebels.com/2022/02/11/unionizingcongressis/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;had asked&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.latinorebels.com/2022/02/11/unionizingcongressis/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22d10001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22d10002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">had asked</a> the question.</p>
<p>That day, Pelosi came out <a href="https://www.politico.com/minutes/congress/02-3-2022/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;in favor&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/minutes/congress/02-3-2022/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22d10003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22d10004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">in favor</a> of a congressional union.</p>
<p>“It’s one of those things where it’s hard to keep bottled in,” the man said. “Like, I can’t believe I’m experiencing this right now and I can’t tell my coworkers or my friends. That was very difficult.”<br></p>

<p>There have been times, of course, when he’s come close to making a mistake.</p>
<p>“I’ll be standing in line at Dunkin’ Donuts and forget that I’ll have my @dear_white_staffers Instagram account up and I’ll quickly switch to my personal account. Or I’ll be looking for a photo and I’ll accidentally scroll through a cropped Instagram DM that I forgot to delete. So there are close calls, kind of all the time. I try to be careful and watch my surroundings.”</p>
<p>On the other end of the gossip, there are some horrific stories, and these can be difficult to read. He carries them around, in his phone, on his person. “Some of the worst things I’ve ever read — physical abuse, mental abuse, stories of suicidal ideation,” he told me. “I would be lying if I said it didn’t take a toll. There are days where it’s very draining.”<br></p>

<p>Since the days of the Pelosi press conference, the incoming DMs have slowed a little, but he still sets aside an hour or two each night to read through new messages. In between memes of Will Smith and the rabid fox that stalked Capitol Hill this month, there are posts about how to support laid-off cafeteria workers and advocate for staff salary raises. New vibe checks are archived at the top of the page. “Are you the only Black woman in your office? Sound off,” he asked this week.</p>
<p>He doesn’t see himself quitting soon, if only because of the goals he has in mind: He wants to see the union become a reality. He wants Hill aides to start thinking of themselves as “workers” in the tradition of the labor movement, deserving of fair treatment and good wages.</p>
<p>And eventually, the man would like to put his name to this story. “It would be great to be public one day,” he said. “But I don’t know what those conditions would look like.”</p>
<p>It will depend on what change comes to Capitol Hill.<br></p>

<br>
<p><b>O</b>n April 21, 1947, two rookie congressmen made their way through the bustle of Washington’s Union Station. Traveling without an entourage, they looked like any of the other business travelers rushing to catch their trains.</p>
<p>They hailed from different parties, different worlds really. But both had served as Navy officers in the South Pacific and had built a cordial, even friendly working relationship as the junior members of the House Committee on Education and Labor.</p>
<p>John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts, 29, still gaunt from his war injuries and numerous ailments that remained well hidden from the voters, was the boyishly handsome, devil-may-care scion of the wealthy East Coast establishment. He had been featured <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1944/06/17/survival" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;in a cover story&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1944/06/17/survival&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22da0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22da0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">in a cover story</a> in the <i>New Yorker</i> magazine for his war exploits a few years earlier and was elected to his seat in November 1946 without much of a fight.<br></p>
<br>
<p>His traveling companion, Richard Nixon of California, nearly five years older, was the socially awkward but ambitious product of a hardworking poor Quaker family. A Duke University Law School graduate, he had been recruited by the city fathers of rural Whittier to run against a veteran Democrat for his House seat, beating him by 14 percentage points in the Republican sweep that seized control of both houses of Congress for the first time since 1933.</p>
<p>The pair of freshmen had been invited by a local civic group to travel 230 miles to McKeesport, Pa., to debate one of the most hotly contested pieces of legislation that had been making its way through their committee. If nothing else, it was a chance for the two new lawmakers to raise their profiles. “We didn’t get that many invitations in those days,” Nixon would recall in an oral history interview years later, “and there was no honorarium.”<br></p>
<br>

<p>The <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/who-we-are/our-history/1947-taft-hartley-substantive-provisions" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Taft-Hartley Act&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/who-we-are/our-history/1947-taft-hartley-substantive-provisions&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22da0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22da0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Taft-Hartley Act</a>, which ultimately passed over President Harry Truman’s veto, would become a signature bill of the new Republican-controlled Congress, a direct challenge to the organizing protections for blue-collar workers strengthened during President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal. And nowhere was the proposed legislation more angrily received than in the industrial heartland of Western Pennsylvania, where steel mills and factories by the score employed thousands of union laborers.</p>
<p>Kennedy and Nixon would have some 18 hours up and back to McKeesport to get to know each other better and discuss the issues of the day. They disagreed on much, but they agreed on a great deal more, especially the emerging landscape of the Cold War, a term that had been coined only <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/bernard-baruch-coins-the-term-cold-war#:~:text=Multimillionaire%20and%20financier%20Bernard%20Baruch,States%20and%20the%20Soviet%20Union" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1651196363081,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-f8ec-dab7-a5ff-fced2e9d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1651196363081,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-f8ec-dab7-a5ff-fced2e9d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/bernard-baruch-coins-the-term-cold-war#:~:text=Multimillionaire%20and%20financier%20Bernard%20Baruch,States%20and%20the%20Soviet%20Union&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-72f8-d337-a9cc-faf8e3c40001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;a few weeks earlier&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-72f8-d337-a9cc-faf8e3c40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">a few weeks earlier</a> but had yet to enter the public lexicon. In the decades to come, they would each sculpt the nation’s political identity, Kennedy for his idealism and glamour and Nixon for his foreign policy achievements and more so for his cynical misuse of power.</p>
<p>But on that day 75 years ago this month, before they were political rivals, they were political <i>arrivals</i> who developed a respectful, even amicable working relationship at a time when societal and partisan divisions were raw and deep. Their first debate, 13 years before their legendary televised duels, is a fleeting and little-known chapter of American political history. It is also a reminder of a time when members of opposite parties, without teams of handlers and policy aides to run interference or shape their message, could disagree vehemently about major issues and yet still place the need to inform and persuade the public above their own political differences.<br></p>
<br>
<img src="https://static.politico.com/d3/83/e7497d7e479e8f29f12383dd6aff/mag.Bender.NixonJFKDebate-Secondary2.jpg">
<br>
<p>Theirs was an era that was arguably as divisive as today — riven by economic anxiety, red-baiting and overt racism. But even still, members of opposing parties could engage with each other — unscripted and in public — and not be punished by their respective leaders for fraternizing with the enemy, or risk being primaried by the ideological extremes of their respective parties for failing a purity test.</p>
<p>Joanne Freeman, a professor of American history at Yale University, says the McKeesport debate is nearly unthinkable in today’s hyper-partisan, social media-driven public square.</p>
<p>“It becomes very tricky to do anything off the cuff, anything friendly, anything that relies on mutual trust between two sides,” she told me. “All it takes is one extremist who takes advantage of it and uses it, and it is totally taken away from the two people who decided they were going to have this quiet debate.</p>
<p>“When the performance changes because technology changes,” she added, “then the democracy changes.”</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center">The Journey to McKeesport</h3>
<p><b>T</b>he coaches, baggage, café and mail cars lurched out of Union Station and began chugging north along the Washington to Pittsburgh route, a journey that would take them deep into the heart of the arsenal of democracy.</p>
<p>It was in Western Pennsylvania where many of the ingredients for the Allied victory over the Axis Powers had been mixed. In McKeesport, a dozen miles southeast of Pittsburgh, the machine shops and mills had help build the armored plates, structural beams, shell casings, gears, motors, drive shafts, landing craft and even PT boats like the one Kennedy skippered — as well as the freight cars and steel rails that carried them to plants and ports across the country and ultimately on to the battlefields of Europe, North Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>But in the nearly two years since the end of the war, the sense of common national purpose had given way to post-war uncertainty. Millions of veterans returning from the fighting sought jobs in industries that were contracting from their peak wartime production. There was violence stemming from labor unrest.<br></p>
<br>

<br>
<p>The factory floors that had fed the war effort were now battlegrounds themselves in the expanding ideological clash with the<b> </b>Soviet Union as management, with the eager backing of their elected representatives in Washington, strove to rid labor unions of members of the American Communist Party. Some organizations, like the Electrical Workers’ Union, which was heavily represented at the Westinghouse plant in McKeesport, were embroiled in an internal war as their leaders were being hauled before Congress and grilled about their political loyalties. Pittsburgh’s Father Charles Owen Rice, a leading anticommunist voice in the heavily Catholic region, had recently penned a handbook titled “How to De-Control Your Union of Communists.”</p>
<p>In Washington, Kennedy and Nixon’s committee debated whether to require every union officer to <a href="http://todayinclh.com/?event=congress-overrides-truman-veto-passes-slave-labor-bill#:~:text=The%20most%20offensive%20civil%20liberties,violent%20overthrow%20of%20the%20government." target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;swear an oath&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://todayinclh.com/?event=congress-overrides-truman-veto-passes-slave-labor-bill#:~:text=The%20most%20offensive%20civil%20liberties,violent%20overthrow%20of%20the%20government.&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22db0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22db0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">swear an oath</a> that “he was not a member of the Communist Party nor affiliated with such party, and that he does not believe in, and is not a member of or supports any organization that believes in or teaches, the overthrow of the United States government by force or by any illegal or unconstitutional means.”  </p>
<p>In those early debates, Kennedy came off as one of the more hawkish members. “Did you ever attend Communist meetings after the time you became a Communist?” he badgered a 22-year-old union member at a field hearing in Milwaukee a few weeks earlier. “You don’t know how many, do you? Do you know where they were held? Any secret meetings?”</p>
<p>New life had also been breathed into the House Committee on Un-American Activities to which Nixon was also assigned — and it was aggressively launching a campaign to root out communists from nearly every major American government, academic and cultural institution, particularly in Hollywood.<br></p>
<br>
<img src="https://static.politico.com/c8/95/af8984374d75afe8b19e4ecfa746/mag.Bender.NixonJFKDebate-Secondary5.jpg">
<br>
<p>The White House was launching a broad offensive of its own.  A month before the McKeesport trip, Truman, accused by Republicans of coddling communists in his administration, announced a program to investigate the loyalty of government employees — long before conspiracy theories emerged of a “deep state” plotting to undermine elected leaders.</p>
<p>The tensions flaring around Nixon and Kennedy were symbolized by the memberships of their committees.</p>
<p>Sitting a few chairs away from Nixon on the Education and Labor Committee was Rep. Clare Hoffman, the seven-term Republican from Michigan who had come of age in the 19th century — and whose views reflected it. Hoffman was widely known for his attacks on Jews and was designated by radio commentator and newspaper columnist Walter Winchell as “the darling of the native fascists and Roosevelt haters.” Hoffman, now in his early 70s, endorsed the isolationist and anti-immigrant America First Party in the 1944 presidential election. </p>
<p>But his rabidly racist and isolationist bent didn’t affect his influence. Hoffman had recently been named chair of the Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Department, from where he would preside over a piece of legislation that proved to be one of the most significant passed that year, which both Nixon and Kennedy supported: The National Security Act of 1947, which established a separate Department of the Air Force, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the National Security Council, the Central Intelligence Agency — the permanent national security state.</p>
<p>On the Un-American Activities Committee to which Nixon was also assigned were the likes of Democrat John Rankin of Mississippi, who was derided the “number one race-baiter in Congress.” Black people and white people could “never live together on terms of social and political equality,” he said, declaring that America had become a dumping ground for “the maimed, the blind, the wounded … the riffraff of the world.”</p>
<p>Rankin once delivered a tirade against Jews on the House floor in the presence of fellow Congressman Michael Edelstein of New York, who it was widely known suffered from a serious heart condition. Rankin’s vitriol led Edelstein, despite doctor’s orders, to rise in a determined defense of his religion. When he was finished, he slowly exited the House chamber — and dropped dead.<br></p>
<br>
<img src="https://static.politico.com/f0/52/2b8c5b994830a863c02734519b71/mag.Bender.NixonJFKDebate-Secondary7.jpg">
<br>
<p>But a new era was beckoning. Also shaping the Education and Labor Committee debates was the thunderous voice of Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., of New York, who was elected two years before Kennedy and Nixon.</p>
<p>The tall and dapper 39-year-old preacher from Harlem was powering the nascent crusade for social and racial justice at a time when Southern congressmen like Rankin unabashedly slung racial epithets on the House floor.</p>
<p>Just a week before the McKeesport debate, Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in professional baseball when he played his first game for the Brooklyn Dodgers. Other tectonic shifts would soon follow, including Truman’s executive order to desegregate the armed forces. </p>
<p>As the train inched toward the center of McKeesport, Nixon and Kennedy saw crumbling brick row houses, many of them squalid tenements housing low-income Black people, Mexicans and the elderly.<br></p>
<br>
<img src="https://static.politico.com/59/b4/a94188bc43a493b10d1c60be74d2/mag.Bender.NixonJFKDebate-Secondary6.jpg">
<br>
<p>But the town of about 50,000 nestled between the Youghiogheny and Monongahela Rivers coursed with vitality. McKeesport was a hive of furniture emporiums, movie houses, groceries, butcher shops, bakeries, bars, restaurants and 5-and-10-cent-stores — all blinking with red and green neon signs in a Babel-like hodgepodge of English, Polish, German, Russian, Swedish, Czech, Hungarian, Yiddish and Italian. Many of the storefronts advertised they were open 24 hours a day to accommodate the round-the-clock shifts at the nearby mills.</p>
<p>The locomotive hissed loudly as it sidled up to the Baltimore &amp; Ohio railroad’s small, one-story red brick station. It was early evening, in a chilly drizzle, when Kennedy and Nixon stepped onto the concrete platform to see it all for themselves.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center">A debate and a near brawl</h3>
<p><b>T</b>he Junto, the civic group that had invited Kennedy and Nixon, usually attracted middle and upper-class businessmen. But at 8 p.m. sharp, the ballroom of the Penn-McKee Hotel, McKeesport’s grandest hostelry, was filled with about 100 people — including a sizable number of union leaders and workers, some still grimy from their shifts at the nearby plants.</p>
<p>The recently passed House version of the labor bill had sparked an immediate outcry in the labor movement of Western Pennsylvania, where strikes were now the norm, including two recent ones at Duquesne Light that literally plunged the region into darkness. The bill prohibited some types of labor strikes and allowed states to pass right-to-work laws banning union shops. The requirement that union leaders sign a “non-communist affidavit” was viewed as an attack on personal liberties.</p>
<p>The moderator of the debate, a tall, crisp-mannered stockbroker with a thin mustache named William Baird, asked Nixon to speak first. The Californian launched into an impassioned defense of the labor bill.</p>
<p>“The public was satisfied with labor laws on V-J Day,” Nixon said of the war years. “But in the year since, we have begun to see a shift in public opinion. We have seen unprecedented labor strife — the automobile strike, the steel strike, the coal strike and even the railroad strike in which the president was forced to intervene.”<br></p>
<br>
<img src="https://static.politico.com/c4/1e/92f561d347099ba13c150d2463bb/mag.Bender.NixonJFKDebate-Secondary4.jpg">
<br>
<p>Labor leaders, he charged, opposed any changes in labor laws. “Union leaders did themselves and their unions a great disservice in their attitudes before the House committee,” Nixon told the crowd, which was growing increasingly restless as he spoke. Nixon, who had recently traveled to Scranton, Pa., to meet with union bosses and members, insisted that the bill benefited the working man and would not deprive them of any rights.</p>
<p>“Nixon was tense, making his points in a pile-driving way,” one of the attendees later told the <i>McKeesport Daily News</i>. “He had an eager willingness to get in there and fight to the last comma.”</p>
<p>Where Nixon was forthright, however, Kennedy was “smooth and genteel,” another attendee, a local attorney, said, as recounted by the <i>Saturday Review</i>. He “appeared casual, confident, more inclined to sidestep and parry than to battle.”</p>
<p>Kennedy countered Nixon that the bill stripped key protections from the working man. “The way some of those provisions read,” he told the audience, “the unions can’t even protect themselves from the competition of the sweatshop.”</p>
<p>“This bill would strike down the union shop and eliminate industry-wide bargaining and collective bargaining,” Kennedy went on. “It certainly isn’t concerned with the workers. It seeks to strangle by restraint the American labor movement.”</p>
<p>When Baird asked for questions, most were aimed at Nixon by angry union members. Baird had a hard time keeping control of the discussion and letting some of the more pro-business viewpoints be aired.<br></p>
<br>
<img src="https://static.politico.com/fa/59/78c31e2745fca7c758c943f3c8ca/mag.Bender.NixonJFKDebate-Secondary8.jpg">
<br>
<p>W.S. Thompson, the secretary of the G.C. Murphy and Co. five-and-dime chain who had greeted Kennedy and Nixon at the train station, was so upset by how Nixon was treated that he wrote him a letter of apology.</p>
<p>But Nixon relished the experience. “I don’t know when I have appeared on a program, which I enjoyed more than the one in McKeesport last week,” he wrote Baird a few days later. The questions from the audience, he said, “went right to the heart of the most controversial issues involved.”</p>
<p>“I think I had a little better of it,” Nixon recalled later.</p>
<p>Kennedy also told Baird he enjoyed the experience “very much.”</p>
<p>Afterward, Nixon and Kennedy and some of their hosts ate at the Star Restaurant, across from the train station, where one topic of discussion was sports, Clifford Flegal, another Navy veteran and local Republican leader who was there, recalled in an interview.</p>
<p>Then the two congressmen shared a sleeping berth on the overnight <i>Capitol Limited</i> back to Washington.<br></p>
<br>
<img src="https://static.politico.com/e3/df/c64dfe6947cabd98e01c5633b3a8/mag.Bender.NixonJFKDebate-Secondary9.jpg">
<br>
<p>“We drew for who got the upper berth and who got the lower berth,” Nixon recounted, “and I won, one of the few times I did against him.”</p>
<p>But they slept little that night. They traded stories about their time in the South Pacific; they thought they might have been posted at the same time on Vella Lavella in the Solomon Islands, according to Nixon.</p>
<p>“We talked about our experiences in the past, but particularly about the world and where we were going,” Nixon said.</p>
<p>“Kennedy and I were too different in background, outlook and temperament to become close friends,” he wrote in his memoirs, “but we were thrown together during our early careers, and we never had less than an amicable relationship. In those early years we saw ourselves as political opponents but not rivals.”</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center">Lasting Respect</h3>
<p><b>W</b>ithin less than six years they would both be senators and in little more than a decade they would square off for the presidency. But their personal bond and mutual respect lasted through it all.</p>
<p>When Kennedy was at death’s door after risky back surgery in 1954, a Secret Service agent riding with then-Vice President Nixon witnessed him cry and mutter that “poor brave Jack is going to die,” Chris Matthews recounted in <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Kennedy-Nixon/Chris-Matthews/9781451644289" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;<i>Kennedy &amp; Nixon</i>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Kennedy-Nixon/Chris-Matthews/9781451644289&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22db0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22db0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><i>Kennedy &amp; Nixon</i></a>. “Oh, God, don’t let him die.”</p>
<p>President Kennedy returned to McKeesport one more time, on Oct. 13, 1962, to stump for fellow Democrats during the midterms. <br></p>
<br>

<br>
<p>Standing in front of McKeesport City Hall in the bright sunshine, he was at the height of power. But storm clouds were also on the horizon. In just three days he would be immersed in the biggest crisis of his presidency, the 13 days of the Cuban Missile Crisis.</p>
<p>“The first time I came to this city was in 1947,” he began his speech to the raucous campaign crowd, “when Mr. Richard Nixon and I engaged in our first debate. He won that one. We went on to other things.”</p>

<p>A cryptocurrency super PAC is poised to make a dent in Pennsylvania’s Senate Democratic primary by supporting Democrat John Fetterman.</p>
<p>A<a href="https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/b2f3ac7a-3c15-445a-8a90-969707cca08a" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot; new TV ad&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/b2f3ac7a-3c15-445a-8a90-969707cca08a&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22df0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22df0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"> new TV ad</a> by Web3 Forward PAC portrays Fetterman as an anti-establishment outsider who has been an advocate for the working class. The commercial does not make any mention of crypto.</p>
<p>“Gonna get schmoozed by lobbyists or bossed around by politicians? Not a chance,” a narrator says in the spot. “John Fetterman’s no stranger to tough fights. As mayor turning around the city of Braddock, crime went down. Jobs came back. As lieutenant governor, saving taxpayers money by refusing to live in the state-owned mansion.”</p>
<p>Joe Calvello, a spokesperson for Fetterman, said that “even though this PAC is supporting John, it doesn’t change his view that super PACs are an example of how deeply broken and dysfunctional our campaign finance system is.”</p>
<p>Fetterman is the progressive frontrunner in the key Democratic primary, which also includes Rep. Conor Lamb and state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta. In a statement provided to POLITICO, Web3 Forward confirmed it is endorsing Fetterman and said “he knows America deserves a better internet.”</p>
<p>“Web 3.0 is the next generation of the internet that will democratize financial access, return ownership of the web to the users, and unlock new opportunities for millions on the margins,” the group said. “John Fetterman is a proponent of American leadership in this space."</p>
<p>Web3 Forward states <a href="https://www.web3forward.com/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;on its website&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.web3forward.com/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22df0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22df0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">on its website</a> that providing “blockchain innovators the ability to develop their networks under a clearer regulatory and legal framework is vital if the broader open blockchain economy is to grow to its full potential here in the United States.”</p>
<p>While the super PAC declined to share how much it expects to spend on the Pennsylvania Senate race, the group has booked more than $200,000 in the next two weeks running up to the May 17 primary, according to the ad-tracking firm AdImpact.</p>

<br>
<p>With the Supreme Court poised to strike down <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, the next battle over abortion rights in America won’t be fought in Washington.</p>
<p>Instead, it will be state-by-state trench warfare — particularly in a small universe of swing<i> </i>states that are poised to play an oversized role in the midterm election and the presidential race to come.</p>
<p>Political operatives and candidates on both sides of the aisle have long said that the Supreme Court’s looming decision on abortion rights could upend<b><i> </i></b>2022, especially in <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/01/abortion-governors-race-california-virginia-508675" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;state-based contests that could actually set new policy&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/01/abortion-governors-race-california-virginia-508675&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22e20000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22e20001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">state-based contests that could actually set new policy</a>. But the conversations about a ruling throwing out <i>Roe </i>became much less theoretical on Monday, after <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;POLITICO obtained a draft opinion&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22e20002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22e20003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">POLITICO obtained a draft opinion</a> authored by Justice Samuel Alito that would completely overturn the decades-old case.<br>It's especially salient in key battleground states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Nevada and elsewhere, where radically different abortion policy could hinge on who is elected governor, or to a handful of state legislative seats — or both.<br></p>
<br><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6305622329112" frameborder="0"></iframe> 
<br>
<p>“The writing was on the wall. But now we see it in black and white, with Judge Alito’s name on it,” said Lavora Barnes, the chair of the Michigan Democratic Party. “It is very different to think about it in the abstract: ‘It’s going to happen, it might happen, it could happen.’ Very different to see it written, and particularly written the way this was written.”</p>
<p>On Tuesday, <a href="https://twitter.com/SCOTUSblog/status/1521509850181742592" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;the high court publicly confirmed&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/SCOTUSblog/status/1521509850181742592&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22e20004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22e20005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">the high court publicly confirmed</a> the authenticity of the draft, but stressed it “does not represent a decision.” Congress is extremely unlikely to act, given Democrats’ narrow majority in the Senate and several senators’ stated unwillingness to scrap the filibuster for a whole host of issues, abortion included. And neither party is expected to win a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate in the fall, which puts the ball in states’ court.</p>
<br>
<p>“If something similar to this alleged Alito draft goes forward, then it's going to shift abortion from a federal issue to a state issue,” said Bill McCoshen, a Wisconsin-based Republican strategist. “And so candidates for the state legislature and for governor are going to have to have a position on abortion in every cycle going forward.”</p>
<p>Democrats have long contended that the scrapping of <i>Roe </i>would motivate their voters, pointing to polling that shows that most Americans believe abortion should be legal in most cases and that <i>Roe </i>should be upheld. Democratic gubernatorial<b><i> </i></b>incumbents and candidates rushed to condemn the draft, casting themselves as the bulwark against restrictive abortion laws being passed in their home state.<br></p>
<br>
<p>Seventeen Democratic governors — including swing-staters like Wisconsin’s Tony Evers, Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer and Nevada’s Steve Sisolak — <a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/WIGOV/2022/05/03/file_attachments/2148925/Evers%20Govs_WHPA_5.3.22.pdf" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;signed a letter to congressional leadership&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/WIGOV/2022/05/03/file_attachments/2148925/Evers%20Govs_WHPA_5.3.22.pdf&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22e20006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22e20007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">signed a letter to congressional leadership</a> urging Congress to act “swiftly to ensure that all Americans continue to have meaningful access to reproductive healthcare and abortion.”</p>
<p>But the immediate political ramifications of the decision are unclear. Democratic party leaders and consultants said they believed it would ultimately motivate base voters and bring some undecided voters back into the fold because most Americans agree with them.

<p>With an eye toward swing voters, Democratic campaigns are already conducting polling on the impact of a ruling on the general election. An internal survey for a Democratic candidate in Pennsylvania, which was provided to POLITICO, found that banning abortion is "unpopular among non-conservative Republicans (an important subset of swing voters)," with 61 percent opposing and 32 percent supporting.<br></p>

<p>Roshni Nedungadi, a pollster at HIT Strategies — which has done work with abortion rights groups — said that the shift for Democratic voters was apparent in a focus group of “young, base” Democrats that her firm was running as POLITICO broke the news on Monday.</p>
<p>“Our moderator asked a question before this news came out: ‘What would you think about the possibility of <i>Roe v. Wade</i> being overturned?’ And people didn't think that it was a realistic possibility until the news broke,” she said. “It took them a moment to process the information. Then they were palpably angry.”</p>
<p>Democrats also expect a financial windfall from the news, even <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/abortion-rights-groups-midterms-00028905" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;beyond the $150 million that pro-abortion rights groups&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/abortion-rights-groups-midterms-00028905&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22e20010&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22e20011&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">beyond the $150 million that pro-abortion rights groups</a> recently committed to spending. Cooper Teboe, a Silicon Valley-based adviser to Democratic donors, said “our priority right now needs to be that women are safe and that they have access.” But, he said, he anticipates a “tremendous” boost in giving from both small- and large-dollar donors.</p>
<p>“Either they're going to get off the sidelines, or they're going to give more than they were,” he said. “And second, we're going to see the grassroots get activated in a similar way to how they were activated during Trump. I don't think anything motivates voters quite like outrage.”<br></p>
<br>
<p>Jenifer Fernandez Ancona, a co-founder and chief strategy officer of the liberal donor collective Way to Win, concurred, saying the draft opinion would bring “more urgency” in their conversations with big donors.</p>
<p>“It's been hard in this midterm a little bit, right, because of all the news about the midterm and how hard it's going to be [for Democrats],” she said. “And so this confirms what we have been saying: that abortion is going to be a mobilizing issue for Democrats, but Democrats have to lean into it. It isn't going to just happen.”</p>
<p>It has already paid early dividends. Will Simons, a spokesperson for Josh Shapiro, the Democratic candidate for governor in Pennsylvania, said Tuesday “this has already been the best online fundraising day of the year for our campaign.”</p>
<p>Republicans contend the landscape is not that clear-cut, pointing to the fact that former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe ran heavily on opposing abortion restrictions during his comeback attempt in 2021, only to still be defeated by now-Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who opposes abortion access but sought to downplay focus on the issue in the run-up to the general election.</p>
<p>Just 8 percent of voters listed abortion as the most important issue facing Virginia, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2021/november/exit-polls/virginia/governor/0" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;according to exit polls&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.cnn.com/election/2021/november/exit-polls/virginia/governor/0&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22e30000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22e30001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">according to exit polls</a>.</p>
<p>“I think it's possible that Democratic voters that care about the <i>Roe v. Wade</i> decision will have a sugar-high, and they’ll be amped up for a little while,” said McCoshen. “But there’s still six-plus months until the general election, and by then I think most voters will be back to focusing on pocketbook issues like inflation and the economy.”</p>
<p>Republicans also <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/9904/Public-Opinion-About-Abortion-InDepth-Review.aspx" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;noted Gallup polling&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://news.gallup.com/poll/9904/Public-Opinion-About-Abortion-InDepth-Review.aspx&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22e30002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22e30003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">noted Gallup polling</a> that shows that a majority of Americans are opposed to abortion in the second and third trimesters.<br></p>
<br>
<p>Indeed, some battleground Republican gubernatorial candidates have embraced the draft opinion. In an interview, former Rep. Lou Barletta — one of the leading Republican candidates in this month’s Pennsylvania gubernatorial primary — said he approved of it. “I don't think it will change the primary at all. I think it will have a huge impact on the general election,” he said.</p>
<p>“Josh Shapiro is clear that he supports abortion,” he said, “and whoever the Republican nominee is has made their position clear that they are in support of protecting the life of the unborn. So there'll be a clear distinction between the two candidates.”</p>
<p>In some Republican state primaries, candidates see the news as an opportunity to boost their campaigns and are tweaking their political strategy in response. <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000180-90e0-d3ee-a392-91fbd9e10000" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;In an internal memo obtained by POLITICO&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000180-90e0-d3ee-a392-91fbd9e10000&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22e30004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22e30005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">In an internal memo obtained by POLITICO</a>, an aide for another top gubernatorial candidate in Pennsylvania, Dave White, predicted that the question of candidate<b> </b>electability will now be even more important for GOP voters.</p>
<p>“Unopposed in the primary, Attorney General Josh Shapiro is set to become the most stridently proabortion gubernatorial candidate in the commonwealth’s history,” they wrote. “It must be made clear to pro-life voters that beating Shapiro is the most important task in this election.”</p>
<p>Shapiro said in a news conference Tuesday that the top four Republican gubernatorial candidates backed an abortion ban, and two allowed for no exceptions for rape, incest or the life of the mother.</p>
<p>“This is an extreme position, and I can tell you it is wildly out of touch with the majority of Pennsylvanians,” he said.</p>
<p>Other battleground Republicans have weighed in as well: Former Sen. David Perdue, who is primarying GOP Gov. Brian Kemp in Georgia, praised the draft ruling in a pair of statements. He highlighted the importance of the three justices former President Donald Trump nominated to the bench, and said if he was governor he would “immediately call the legislature back into a special session to ban abortion in Georgia.”</p>
<p>But privately, some Republicans were more skittish about the impact on the midterms and urged candidates to proceed carefully.</p>
<p>A GOP consultant in Wisconsin, referring to that state’s gubernatorial race, said “the issue within the Republican primary is whether or not candidates are going to treat it with the proper delicacy that they'll need to treat it in the fall.”</p>
<p>“That doesn't mean not being glad to see a court decision that many of them have fought for their entire lives. And it doesn't mean not being rock-ribbed about their pro-life credentials,” the person added. “In fact, they need to do that in a primary like the governor’s race. But it needs to be done in a way that can have a shelf life in the fall.”<br></p>
<br>
<p>An early test of the saliency of abortion in the midterms will be in Kansas, which is arguably Republicans’ best opportunity to flip a governorship this year, with Gov. Laura Kelly the only Democratic incumbent up for reelection in a state that Trump carried in 2020.</p>
<p>During the state’s August primary, Kansans will vote on a proposed state constitutional amendment that would explicitly say the state constitution <a href="https://www.kcur.org/news/2022-05-03/roe-v-wade-decision-will-mean-kansas-abortion-rights-hinge-on-a-state-vote-in-august" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;does not establish a right&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.kcur.org/news/2022-05-03/roe-v-wade-decision-will-mean-kansas-abortion-rights-hinge-on-a-state-vote-in-august&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22e30006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22e30007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">does not establish a right</a> to an abortion in the state, after the state Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that it did.</p>
<p>And red-state Republican governors are moving on the issue as well. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, a potential 2024 candidate, <a href="https://twitter.com/govkristinoem/status/1521303498545061889" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;tweeted in response to POLITICO’s reporting&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/govkristinoem/status/1521303498545061889&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22e30008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22e30009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">tweeted in response to POLITICO’s reporting</a> that she would “immediately call for a special session” should <i>Roe v. Wade </i>be overturned.</p>
<p>Beyond gubernatorial contests, abortion politics could also factor in heavily in other state races — including attorneys general, who could make prosecutorial decisions, and state legislators, who actually write the laws governors decide to sign or veto.</p>
<p>Jessica Post, the president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said that she believed that the overturning of <i>Roe </i>would be a motivating decision for Democratic-leaning voters who may have become “complacent” with the party having unified control in Washington.</p>
<p>“It gives Democrats a united enemy. The Supreme Court is taking rights away, and that we need to stand up and fight,” she said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<br>
<p>With a roster of more than 130 endorsements in midterm races to date, Donald Trump has put his political capital on the line in dozens of states and scores of primaries.</p>
<p>Last year, in special Senate and House elections, the former president's record was mixed: Kelly Loeffler of Georgia and Susan Wright of Texas lost their bids, while Mike Carey of Ohio and Julia Letlow of Louisiana won.</p>
<p>This year, his record is considerably better. In the March Texas primaries, his first true test of 2022, all of Trump’s chosen congressional and statewide candidates won their races with the exception of scandal-plagued state Attorney General Ken Paxton, who is in a runoff later this month.</p>
<p>In Tuesday's Indiana and Ohio primaries, Trump once again ran the table: All 22 of his endorsed candidates won. He threw his support behind almost every House GOP incumbent running for reelection — and a few hopefuls in open seat primaries — and his preferred candidate won in every case. His pick in the the highest profile race of the day, the Ohio Senate GOP primary, also won the nomination largely due to Trump's endorsement power. </p>
<p>Of course, the bar for success wasn't that high: Trump backed numerous incumbents who faced token primary opposition or were unopposed.<br></p>
<br><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6305616913112" frameborder="0"></iframe> 
<br>
<p>Notably, Trump did not endorse in the Ohio governor's race, where Republican Gov. Mike DeWine — one of the first prominent Republicans to acknowledge President Joe Biden’s victory — fended off a stiff primary challenge. Trump bypassed the Indiana Senate race as well, where Sen. Todd Young — who <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/todd-young-indiana-senate-trump-00029217" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;said Trump bears responsibility&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/todd-young-indiana-senate-trump-00029217&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22e60000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22e60001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">said Trump bears responsibility</a> for the January 6 attacks — won renomination. Trump also didn’t back Rep.

<p>Here is a look at the 22 Trump-endorsed candidates who won Tuesday.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center">Ohio wins</h2>
<h4 style="text-align: left">Secretary of State</h4>
<h3 style="text-align: left">Frank LaRose</h3>
<p>Won with 65 percent of the vote. The incumbent secretary of state was an ardent defender of the 2020 election process, saying both Trump and Biden needed to stop questioning election integrity. But LaRose took a more partisan turn in the last few months, tweeting that “President Trump is right to say voter fraud is a serious problem,” despite no evidence of widespread malpractice. </p>
<h4 style="text-align: left">Attorney General</h4>
<h3 style="text-align: left">Dave Yost</h3>
<p>Unopposed.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left">U.S. Senate</h4>
<h3 style="text-align: left">J.D. Vance</h3>
<br>
<img src="https://static.politico.com/45/fc/bd954d3c4b218df32e158030e803/220502-jd-vance-ap-773.jpg">
<br>
<p>Won with 32 percent of the vote. </p>
<p>Vance, the author of the book “Hillbilly Elegy,” once referred to Trump as “an idiot,” called himself a “Never Trump guy” and said he considered voting for Hillary Clinton. But he changed his tune once he began his pursuit of the Senate nomination. His conversion to full-throated Trump supporter paid off as Trump delivered his stamp of approval not long before the primary — an endorsement that helped power Vance to victory. Vance will face Democratic nominee Tim Ryan in November.<br></p>

<h3 style="text-align: left">Bill Johnson</h3>
<p>Won with 77 percent of the vote. Johnson voted to overturn 2020 election results.</p>

<br>
<p>Won with 72 percent of the vote. </p>
<p>Miller, a former Trump aide, was by far the highest fundraiser in the race for the solid Republican district. He was originally endorsed by Trump to take on Rep. Anthony Gonzalez, who was one of 10 House Republicans to vote for Trump's impeachment before he decided to retire. </p>
<h4 style="text-align: left">OH-08</h4>
<h3 style="text-align: left">Warren Davidson</h3>

<br>
<p>Won with 29 percent of the vote. </p>
<p>Gesiotto Gilbert is a conservative commentator and attorney who served as co-chair of the Women for Trump advisory board.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left">OH-15</h4>
<h3 style="text-align: left">Mike Carey</h3>
<p>Unopposed. Carey, a former coal lobbyist, got Trump’s endorsement last year during a special election to replace Republican Rep. Steve Stivers. He captured it a second time in April, as Trump noted, "With my endorsement, Mike resoundingly won his special election last year."</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center">Indiana wins</h2>
<h4 style="text-align: left">IN-02</h4>
<h3 style="text-align: left">Jackie Walorski</h3>
<p>Unopposed. Walorski voted to overturn 2020 election results.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left">IN-03</h4>
<h3 style="text-align: left">Jim Banks</h3>
<p>Unopposed. The head of the Republican Study Committee, the House GOP's largest caucus, Banks voted to overturn 2020 election results.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left">IN-04</h4>

<br>
<p>Won with 78 percent of the vote. </p>
<p>The older brother of former Vice President Mike Pence, Greg Pence voted to overturn 2020 election results. In his endorsement, Trump made no mention of his strained relationship with Pence's younger brother. “Greg is working hard to reverse Joe Biden’s disastrous record of out-of-control Inflation and restore the respect our Country deserves from abroad. He is Strong on the Border, Protects Life, Defends the Second Amendment, and Supports our brave Military and Vets,” Trump said in a statement.</p>

<br>
<p>Tech billionaire Peter Thiel had already donated a record-breaking amount of money to support J.D. Vance in the Ohio Republican Senate primary — but last week, the Silicon Valley tycoon decided he wanted to give even more.</p>
<p>“Peter would like to make another contribution to the PAC, this time for $1.5 million,” a top Thiel lieutenant wrote to strategists running a pro-Vance super PAC in an April 26 email, a copy of which was obtained by POLITICO. “We are planning to send the wire today, but before doing so I just wanted to confirm you have everything you need from us.”</p>
<p>With that previously unreported donation, Thiel had given $15 million in total to bolster Vance — the largest amount ever given to boost a single Senate candidate. Thiel is a contrarian who became famous for making risky investments that paid off — and with Vance’s win in Tuesday’s primary, the PayPal co-founder and early Facebook financier struck it big again.</p>
<p>Vance was hardly a sure thing. His campaign was outspent by his better-funded rivals, and he had a long history of making anti-Trump statements that could have gone over poorly with GOP primary voters<b>.</b> In February, his campaign suffered a damaging leak of confidential polling data that painted a grim picture of his prospects, chilled his fundraising and set off a forensic hunt for a potential mole.<br></p>
<br>
<p>And unbeknownst to his political advisers, a rival campaign had gained access to some of the Vance operation’s most sensitive documents, giving them a bird's-eye view into their plans.</p>
<p>But Vance — like many of Thiel’s venture capital investments — took an unusual path to the top, one aimed specifically at helping him win former President Donald Trump’s endorsement and then, in turn, the nomination.</p>
<p>While Vance’s rivals took the conventional route and funneled millions of dollars into TV commercials, Vance mostly outsourced his advertising to the Thiel-funded super PAC, instead focusing on winning free media attention from conservative outlets.</p>
<p>And while his rivals relentlessly pursued Trump’s all-important endorsement with repeated trips to the former president’s Mar-a-Lago estate, Vance kept his distance after an early meeting — and ultimately won over the image-focused Trump anyway, with the former president privately telling Vance he had a “beautiful” golf swing and was a “handsome son of a b----.”</p>
<p>“J.D. really had to carve his own path,” said Republican strategist Luke Thompson, who ran Vance’s allied super PAC. “There was no traditional path to victory, so doing things conventionally wasn't an option."<br></p>

<br>
<h3 style="text-align: left">Courting Trump — and keeping him at bay</h3>
<p>While Vance’s rivals were racing to win Trump’s endorsement as the primary got underway, Vance was forced to start by playing a very different game: trying to keep the former president from attacking him. After all, during the 2016 campaign Vance had identified himself as “Never Trump,” said he “loathed” the former president and once wondered on Twitter: “What percentage of the American population has @RealDonaldTrump sexually assaulted?”</p>
<p>They were the kind of statements that typically infuriated Trump, and that led Vance to try to soothe the former president during a spring 2021 meeting at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort. During the sit-down, which was chaperoned by Thiel and also attended by Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., Vance argued that he was aligned with Trump on the populist issues the former president cared about. The candidate took other steps to win over Trump, including befriending his eldest son, who would become Vance’s closest ally in the former president’s orbit.<br></p>
<br>

<br>
<p>By the fall, Vance’s poll numbers were on the rise, and it appeared there was a thaw in the relationship between Trump and Vance. But Vance was soon dealt a setback when the Club for Growth, which was backing Vance rival Josh Mandel, pulverized him with TV ads highlighting his past anti-Trump remarks.</p>
<p>Trump appeared to cool on the candidate.</p>
<p>While he “really liked J.D.,” Trump told friends, the “Club ads” just “killed him dead.”</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">The secret website</h3>
<p>Last fall, Thompson wrote a memo to Thiel’s team and other donors explaining that the pro-Vance super PAC would have to operate very differently from other outside groups, carrying much of the load that the Vance campaign couldn’t.</p>
<p>Vance was a first-time candidate, and he lacked a donor base able to keep up on the fundraising front with his rivals, some of whom poured millions of dollars from personal fortunes into their campaign accounts. The disparity showed in the campaigns: Vance had a bare-bones team, with only one communications staffer.</p>
<p>As the primary got underway, the super PAC took on the responsibilities typically overseen by campaigns: It built out an extensive data operation, sent text messages to supporters encouraging them to attend Vance’s events, and hosted tele-town hall events the candidate participated in. But the most striking maneuver was one that wasn’t mentioned in the memo.</p>
<p>Shortly after Vance launched his campaign last summer, Thompson set up a public website where he published a trove of sensitive documents — from thousands of pages of polling data, to memos assessing the strengths and weaknesses of Vance’s opponents, to a 177-page opposition research book detailing all of the areas where Vance’s opponents might attack him. There were suggested lines for Vance to use on the campaign trail, and even guidance on how the candidate could win Trump’s endorsement.<br></p>
<br>
<img src="https://static.politico.com/70/72/8f19eb84466ba7b91a2cc7519807/20220503-peterthiel-ap-773.jpg">
<br>
<p>All of it was out in the open for the world to see. But it had one intended audience: the Vance campaign.</p>
<p>The site — housed on the publishing platform Medium under the username <a href="https://medium.com/@protectohiovaluesforms" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;@protectohiovaluesforms&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://medium.com/@protectohiovaluesforms&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22eb0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22eb0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">@protectohiovaluesforms</a> — allowed the super PAC to publicly convey information to the Vance campaign without breaking federal laws prohibiting coordination between big-spending outside groups and campaigns. By accessing the website, the lesser-funded Vance campaign was able to capitalize on the resources of the Thiel-funded super PAC.</p>
<p>While organizations from both parties have set up similar websites, the sheer amount of information on the Medium site — and the danger associated with laying so much out in public — set it apart.</p>
<p>“We knew we were going to have less to work with from the start, so we had to take risks and be innovative to keep our donors and supporters engaged,” said Thompson, who worked on the big-spending super PAC that bolstered former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in the 2016 presidential campaign. “That included risking having all of our research in public. But if we hadn’t taken those risks, we would never be in a position to contend for the lead and for a presidential endorsement.”</p>
<p>As the Vance team would soon find out, they were right to be concerned.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">Whack-a-mole</h3>
<p>Vance had reset his campaign early this year following the Club for Growth’s scorching TV blitz, when he was dealt a serious blow: The publication of a 98-page <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/07/jd-vance-warning-ohio-senate-race-00006310" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;internal polling memo&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/07/jd-vance-warning-ohio-senate-race-00006310&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22eb0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22eb0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">internal polling memo</a> in POLITICO warning that Vance was in a “precipitous decline.”</p>
<p>Donors started closing their wallets, and within the super PAC, which commissioned the survey, the hunt was on for the leaker. Thompson examined drafts of the memo and compared them to what was published. He tried to determine if someone might have accessed the document from the Medium platform by examining the server’s logs. And he reached out to his data team, Deep Root Analytics, for assistance in the search.</p>
<p>While Thompson narrowed down a list of potential suspects, he never settled on one.<br></p>
<br>
<img src="https://static.politico.com/ed/d8/b8a90460458c9c62113ceead25b5/20220503-joshmandel-ap-773.jpg">
<br>
<p>Another problem had developed: Mandel’s campaign had discovered the Medium site and was plumbing it for intel. The Mandel team had been spending months poring over the reams of polling data, the detailed state-of-the race memos, and advertising spending plans, using all of it to adjust their own strategy.</p>
<p>It was a stunning breach, one that gave one of Vance’s chief rivals visibility into his operation.</p>
<p>Officials on the pro-Vance super PAC never knew about the snooping; while they tracked the site’s traffic, they couldn’t tell who the visitors were. The Mandel campaign flagged the website to POLITICO late last week.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">Tucker, Ukraine and vaccines</h3>
<p>While Vance’s opponents flooded the TV airwaves with millions of dollars in commercials, the more cash-strapped Vance generated free media attention for himself by running as a fire-breathing, controversy-embracing populist. The candidate took to conservative outlets like Breitbart News, Steve Bannon’s “War Room” podcast, and Tucker Carlson's Fox News show. He declared that Mexican drug cartels should be labeled “terrorist organizations,” called for “mass civil disobedience” in response to vaccine requirements and argued against American involvement in Russia's war on Ukraine.</p>
<p>Vance’s position on Ukraine turned off donors and cut against popular opinion that backed aiding the country’s fight against Russian aggression with supplies, if not with American troops. But the candidate made up for it with loads of media attention. According to media tracking information, Vance has been mentioned on broadcast TV stations more than 7,200 times since June 1, 2021, more than twice as much as his nearest rival, Mandel.</p>
<p>The bomb-throwing rhetoric was also about repositioning himself as a conservative after being tagged as anti-Trump.<br></p>
<br><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6262601564001" frameborder="0"></iframe> 
<br>
<p>In February, Thompson posted a memo to the Medium site arguing that Vance had an opening to zero in on immigration and border security, noting that he had a “personal” connection to the issue given his mother’s struggles with drug addiction. The issue was near and dear to primary voters, the memo argued, and crucially, could help in nabbing Trump’s support.</p>
<p>“To win a Trump endorsement, a candidate has to show growing ballot share. To get that, a candidate has to own a critical issue,” the memo read. “JD can do that.”</p>
<p>When Vance took the stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Florida later that month, he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyloqoIwq1M" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;focused squarely on immigration&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyloqoIwq1M&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22eb0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22eb0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">focused squarely on immigration</a>. And when the campaign went up with its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3qYJoSV0lI" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;first TV ad&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3qYJoSV0lI&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22eb0006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22eb0007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">first TV ad</a> last month, it showed a direct-to-camera Vance telling viewers that he “nearly lost” his “mother to the poison coming across our border” — just like his super PAC suggested.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">Trump makes his move</h3>
<p>As winter turned to spring, the race for Trump’s endorsement accelerated — and just about everyone involved in the primary knew it would likely decide the eventual nominee.</p>
<p>While Trump was aware of Vance’s past condemnations, he was hearing from allies including Carlson and Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley who encouraged him to get behind the candidate. And he had recently seen Vance playing golf at Mar-a-Lago, where he complimented the candidate on his swing and his personal appearance. But for the TV-obsessed Trump, it was Vance’s performance in the debates that led the former president to endorse his onetime critic.</p>
<p>Trump had met with Mandel and investment banker Mike Gibbons, among other candidates in the field. But he was repulsed when he was shown a clip of the two nearly coming to blows during a March forum. After watching one of later debates in full, the president told advisers he was unimpressed with all of those running, except for Vance.<br></p>
<br>
<p>Donald Trump Jr., who had privately grown close to Vance, was by that point edging closer to going public with his support for the candidate. After several of Vance’s rivals in March came out in support of imposing a European-led no-fly zone in Ukraine, which Vance opposed, the younger Trump took to Twitter to praise him as “100% America First.”</p>
<p>But to get Trump to endorse, those on the Vance team recognized they needed to increase his standing in polls, which had shown him trailing throughout the primary. That meant the super PAC would go for broke.</p>
<p>On Feb. 10, Thompson took to Medium and posted a picture of an atomic bomb going off, with the caption, “Bombs away.” The next day, the organization emptied out its bank account with a TV ad blitz promoting Vance.</p>
<p>In mid-April, Trump called a Thiel associate and told them he was moving closer to endorsing Vance. Thiel, a Vance mentor who had been a financial backer of Vance’s Narya venture capital firm, had been playing a key role for the candidate. In addition to donating millions to the pro-Vance super PAC, Thiel helped to recruit around 10 more major donors to Vance. He introduced the candidate to venture capitalist David Sacks, who donated $1 million to the super PAC and hosted a December fundraising reception.</p>
<p>On April 15, Trump made his endorsement of Vance official — a nod that pushed Vance to victory. "It was his endorsement that secured the nomination for J.D.," said senior Vance adviser Andy Surabian.</p>
<p>Within days, the candidate had vaulted into first place in polling. And Tuesday night, Vance celebrated his win with a congratulatory phone call from the former president.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<br>
<p>The Supreme Court has voted to strike down the landmark <i>Roe v. Wade</i> decision, according to an <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/read-justice-alito-initial-abortion-opinion-overturn-roe-v-wade-pdf-00029504" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1651542824341,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000164-1da5-dd88-af77-ffafea040000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1651542824341,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000164-1da5-dd88-af77-ffafea040000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/read-justice-alito-initial-abortion-opinion-overturn-roe-v-wade-pdf-00029504&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-8754-d7d2-adbc-ff5676790001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;initial draft majority opinion&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-8754-d7d2-adbc-ff5676790000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">initial draft majority opinion</a> written by Justice Samuel Alito circulated inside the court and obtained by POLITICO.</p>
<p>The draft opinion is a full-throated, unflinching repudiation of the 1973 decision which guaranteed federal constitutional protections of abortion rights and a subsequent 1992 decision — <i>Planned Parenthood v. Casey</i> — that largely maintained the right. “<i>Roe</i> was egregiously wrong from the start,” Alito writes.</p>
<p>“We hold that <i>Roe</i> and <i>Casey</i> must be overruled,” he writes in the document, labeled as the “Opinion of the Court.” “It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people’s elected representatives.”<br></p>
<br>
<p><br>Deliberations on controversial cases have in the past been fluid. Justices can and sometimes do change their votes as draft opinions circulate and major decisions can be subject to multiple drafts and vote-trading, sometimes until just days before a decision is unveiled. The court’s holding will not be final until it is published, likely in the next two months.</p>
<p>The immediate impact of the ruling as drafted in February would be to end a half-century guarantee of federal constitutional protection of abortion rights and allow each state to decide whether to restrict or ban abortion. It’s unclear if there have been subsequent changes to the draft.</p>
<p>No draft decision in the modern history of the court has been disclosed publicly while a case was still pending. The unprecedented revelation is bound to intensify the debate over what was already the most controversial case on the docket this term.<br></p>
<br><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6305570233112" frameborder="0"></iframe> 
<br>
<p>The draft opinion offers an extraordinary window into the justices’ deliberations in one of the most consequential cases before the court in the last five decades. Some court-watchers predicted that the conservative majority would slice away at abortion rights without flatly overturning a 49-year-old precedent. The draft shows that the court is looking to reject <i>Roe</i>’s logic and legal protections.</p>
<br>
<p><br>A person familiar with the court’s deliberations said that four of the other Republican-appointed justices — Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett — had voted with Alito in the conference held among the justices after hearing oral arguments in December, and that line-up remains unchanged as of this week.</p>
<p>The three Democratic-appointed justices — Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan — are working on one or more dissents, according to the person. How Chief Justice John Roberts will ultimately vote, and whether he will join an already written opinion or draft his own, is unclear.</p>
<p>The document, labeled as a first draft of the majority opinion, includes a notation that it was circulated among the justices on Feb. 10. If the Alito draft is adopted, it would rule in favor of Mississippi in the closely watched case over that state’s attempt to ban most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, after this article was published, Roberts confirmed the authenticity of the draft opinion and said he was ordering an investigation into the disclosure.</p>
<p>“To the extent this betrayal of the confidences of the Court was intended to undermine the integrity of our operations, it will not succeed. The work of the Court will not be affected in any way,” Roberts pledged in a written statement. “This was a singular and egregious breach of that trust that is an affront to the Court and the community of public servants who work here.”</p>
<p>Roberts also stressed that the draft opinion “does not represent a decision by the Court or the final position of any member on the issues in the case.” The court spokesperson had declined comment pre-publication. <br></p>
<br>
<p><br>POLITICO received a copy of the draft opinion from a person familiar with the court’s proceedings in the Mississippi case along with other details supporting the authenticity of the document. The draft opinion runs 98 pages, including a 31-page appendix of historical state abortion laws. The document is replete with citations to previous court decisions, books and other authorities, and includes 118 footnotes. The appearances and timing of this draft are consistent with court practice.</p>
<p>The disclosure of Alito’s draft majority opinion — a rare breach of Supreme Court secrecy and tradition around its deliberations — comes as all sides in the abortion debate are girding for the ruling. Speculation about the looming decision has been intense since the December oral arguments indicated a majority was inclined to support the Mississippi law.</p>
<p>Under long-standing court procedures, justices hold preliminary votes on cases shortly after argument and assign a member of the majority to write a draft of the court’s opinion. The draft is often amended in consultation with other justices, and in some cases the justices change their votes altogether, creating the possibility that the current alignment on <i>Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization</i> could change.</p>
<p>The chief justice typically assigns majority opinions when he is in the majority. When he is not, that decision is typically made by the most senior justice in the majority.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left">‘Exceptionally weak’</h2>
<p>A George W. Bush appointee who joined the court in 2006, Alito argues that the 1973 abortion rights ruling was an ill-conceived and deeply flawed decision that invented a right mentioned nowhere in the Constitution and unwisely sought to wrench the contentious issue away from the political branches of government.</p>
<p>Alito's draft ruling would overturn a decision by the New Orleans-based 5th Circuit Court of Appeals that found the Mississippi law ran afoul of Supreme Court precedent by seeking to effectively ban abortions before viability.</p>
<p><i>Roe</i>’s “survey of history ranged from the constitutionally irrelevant to the plainly incorrect,” Alito continues, adding that its reasoning was “exceptionally weak,” and that the original decision has had “damaging consequences.”</p>
<p>“The inescapable conclusion is that a right to abortion is not deeply rooted in the Nation’s history and traditions,” Alito writes.</p>
<p>Alito approvingly quotes a broad range of critics of the <i>Roe</i> decision. He also points to liberal icons such as the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Harvard Law Professor Laurence Tribe, who at certain points in their careers took issue with the reasoning in <i>Roe </i>or its impact on the political process.</p>
<p>Alito’s skewering of <i>Roe </i>and the endorsement of at least four other justices for that unsparing critique is also a measure of the court’s rightward turn in recent decades. <i>Roe </i>was decided 7-2 in 1973, with five Republican appointees joining two justices nominated by Democratic presidents.</p>
<p>The overturning of <i>Roe </i>would almost immediately lead to stricter limits on abortion access in large swaths of the South and Midwest, with about half of the states set to immediately impose broad abortion bans. Any state could still legally allow the procedure.<br></p>
<br>
<p><br>“The Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each State from regulating or prohibiting abortion,” the draft concludes. “<i>Roe</i> and <i>Casey</i> arrogated that authority. We now overrule those decisions and return that authority to the people and their elected representatives.”</p>
<p>The draft contains the type of caustic rhetorical flourishes Alito is known for and that has caused Roberts, his fellow Bush appointee, some discomfort in the past.</p>
<p>At times, Alito’s draft opinion takes an almost mocking tone as it skewers the majority opinion in <i>Roe,</i> written by Justice Harry Blackmun, a Richard Nixon appointee who died in 1999.</p>
<p>“<i>Roe </i>expressed the ‘feel[ing]’ that the Fourteenth Amendment was the provision that did the work, but its message seemed to be that the abortion right could be found <i>somewhere</i> in the Constitution and that specifying its exact location was not of paramount importance,” Alito writes.</p>
<p>Alito declares that one of the central tenets of <i>Roe</i>, the “viability” distinction between fetuses not capable of living outside the womb and those which can, “makes no sense.”</p>
<br>
<p><br>In several passages, he describes doctors and nurses who terminate pregnancies as “abortionists.”</p>
<p>When Roberts voted with liberal jurists in 2020 to block a Louisiana law imposing heavier regulations on abortion clinics, his <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/18-1323#writing-18-1323_CONCUR_4" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;solo concurrence&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/18-1323#writing-18-1323_CONCUR_4&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22ef0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22ef0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">solo concurrence</a> used the more neutral term “abortion providers.” In contrast, Justice Clarence Thomas used the word “abortionist” 25 times in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/18-1323#writing-18-1323_DISSENT_5" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;a solo dissent&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/18-1323#writing-18-1323_DISSENT_5&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22ef0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22ef0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">a solo dissent</a> in the same case.</p>
<p>Alito’s use of the phrase “egregiously wrong” to describe <i>Roe</i> echoes language Mississippi Solicitor General Scott Stewart used in December in defending his state’s ban on abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.

<p>In that opinion, Kavanaugh labeled two well-known Supreme Court decisions “egregiously wrong when decided”: the 1944 ruling upholding the detention of Japanese Americans during World War II, <i>Korematsu v. United States</i>, and the 1896 decision that blessed racial segregation under the rubric of “separate but equal,” <i>Plessy v. Ferguson.</i></p>
<p>The high court has never formally overturned <i>Korematsu</i>, but did <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/26/supreme-court-overturns-korematsu-673846" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;repudiate the decision&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/26/supreme-court-overturns-korematsu-673846&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22ef0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22ef0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">repudiate the decision</a> in a 2018 ruling by Roberts that upheld then-President Donald Trump’s travel ban policy.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left">The legacy of Plessy v. Ferguson</h2>
<p><i>Plessy</i> remained the law of the land for nearly six decades until the court overturned it with the <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i> school desegregation ruling in 1954.</p>
<p>Quoting Kavanaugh, Alito writes of <i>Plessy</i>: “It was ‘egregiously wrong,’ on the day it was decided.”</p>
<p>Alito’s draft opinion includes, in small type, a list of about two pages’ worth of decisions in which the justices overruled prior precedents — in many instances reaching results praised by liberals.</p>
<p>The implication that allowing states to outlaw abortion is on par with ending legal racial segregation has been hotly disputed. But the comparison underscores the conservative justices’ belief that <i>Roe</i> is so flawed that the justices should disregard their usual hesitations about overturning precedent and wholeheartedly renounce it.</p>
<p>Alito’s draft opinion ventures even further into this racially sensitive territory by observing in a footnote that some early proponents of abortion rights also had unsavory views in favor of eugenics.</p>
<p>“Some such supporters have been motivated by a desire to suppress the size of the African American population,” Alito writes. “It is beyond dispute that <i>Roe</i> has had that demographic effect. A highly disproportionate percentage of aborted fetuses are black.”</p>
<p>Alito writes that by raising the point he isn’t casting aspersions on anyone. “For our part, we do not question the motives of either those who have supported and those who have opposed laws restricting abortion,” he writes.</p>
<p>Alito also addresses concern about the impact the decision could have on public discourse. “We cannot allow our decisions to be affected by any extraneous influences such as concern about the public’s reaction to our work,” Alito writes. “We do not pretend to know how our political system or society will respond to today’s decision overruling <i>Roe</i> and <i>Casey</i>. And even if we could foresee what will happen, we would have no authority to let that knowledge influence our decision.”</p>
<p>In the main opinion in the 1992 <i>Casey</i> decision, Justices Sandra Day O’Connor, Anthony Kennedy and Davis Souter warned that the court would pay a “terrible price” for overruling <i>Roe</i>, despite criticism of the decision from some in the public and the legal community.</p>
<p>“While it has engendered disapproval, it has not been unworkable,” the three justices wrote then. “An entire generation has come of age free to assume <i>Roe</i>'s concept of liberty in defining the capacity of women to act in society, and to make reproductive decisions; no erosion of principle going to liberty or personal autonomy has left <i>Roe</i>'s central holding a doctrinal remnant.”</p>
<p>When <i>Dobbs</i> was argued in December,<i> </i>Roberts seemed out of sync with the other conservative justices, as he has been in a number of cases including one challenging the Affordable Care Act.</p>
<p>At the argument session last fall, Roberts seemed to be searching for a way to uphold Mississippi’s 15-week ban without completely abandoning the <i>Roe</i> framework.</p>
<p>“Viability, it seems to me, doesn't have anything to do with choice. But, if it really is an issue about choice, why is 15 weeks not enough time?” Roberts asked during the arguments. “The thing that is at issue before us today is 15 weeks.”</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left">Nods to conservative colleagues</h2>
<p>While Alito’s draft opinion doesn’t cater much to Roberts’ views, portions of it seem intended to address the specific interests of other justices. One passage argues that social attitudes toward out-of-wedlock pregnancies “have changed drastically” since the 1970s and that increased demand for adoption makes abortion less necessary.</p>
<p>Those points dovetail with issues that Barrett — a Trump appointee and the court’s newest member — raised at the December arguments. She suggested laws allowing people to surrender newborn babies on a no-questions-asked basis mean carrying a pregnancy to term doesn’t oblige one to engage in child rearing.</p>
<p>“Why don’t the safe haven laws take care of that problem?” asked Barrett, who adopted two of her seven children.</p>
<p>Much of Alito’s draft is devoted to arguing that widespread criminalization of abortion during the 19th and early 20th century belies the notion that a right to abortion is implied in the Constitution.</p>
<p>The conservative justice attached to his draft a 31-page appendix listing laws passed to criminalize abortion during that period. Alito claims “an unbroken tradition of prohibiting abortion on pain of criminal punishment…from the earliest days of the common law until 1973.”</p>
<p>“Until the latter part of the 20th century, there was no support in American law for a constitutional right to obtain an abortion. Zero. None. No state constitutional provision had recognized such a right,” Alito adds.</p>
<p>Alito’s draft argues that rights protected by the Constitution but not explicitly mentioned in it — so-called unenumerated rights — must be strongly rooted in U.S. history and tradition. That form of analysis seems at odds with several of the court’s recent decisions, including many of its rulings backing gay rights.</p>
<br>
<p><br>Liberal justices seem likely to take issue with Alito’s assertion in the draft opinion that overturning <i>Roe</i> would not jeopardize other rights the courts have grounded in privacy, such as the right to contraception, to engage in private consensual sexual activity and to marry someone of the same sex.</p>
<p>“We emphasize that our decision concerns the constitutional right to abortion and no other right,” Alito writes. “Nothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion.”</p>
<p>Alito's draft opinion rejects the idea that abortion bans reflect the subjugation of women in American society. “Women are not without electoral or political power,” he writes. “The percentage of women who register to vote and cast ballots is consistently higher than the percentage of men who do so."</p>
<p>The Supreme Court remains one of Washington’s most secretive institutions, priding itself on protecting the confidentiality of its internal deliberations.</p>
<p>“At the Supreme Court, those who know don’t talk, and those who talk don’t know,” Ginsburg was fond of saying.</p>
<p>That tight-lipped reputation has eroded somewhat in recent decades due to a series of books by law clerks, law professors and investigative journalists. Some of these authors clearly had access to draft opinions such as the one obtained by POLITICO, but their books emerged well after the cases in question were resolved.</p>
<p>The justices held their final arguments of the current term on Wednesday. The court has set a series of sessions over the next two months to release rulings in its still-unresolved cases, including the Mississippi abortion case.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<br>
<p>Now that Chief Justice John Roberts has ordered an investigation into the breach of an initial draft majority opinion overturning <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, what happens next is a total mystery.</p>
<p>There are virtually no precedents for Roberts’ plans to identify the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/read-justice-alito-initial-abortion-opinion-overturn-roe-v-wade-pdf-00029504" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;98-page document&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/read-justice-alito-initial-abortion-opinion-overturn-roe-v-wade-pdf-00029504&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22f30000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22f30001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">98-page document</a>’s path from the high court to the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;pages of POLITICO&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22f30002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22f30003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">pages of POLITICO</a>, a disclosure he termed a “betrayal” of the institution’s trust. Supreme Court leak controversies have occasionally sparked national intrigue and even calls for federal investigations, but those calls haven’t resulted in any significant investigation.</p>
<p>“We are very much in uncharted territory here,” said Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the law school at the University of California at Berkeley. “Never before, to my knowledge, has a Supreme Court opinion been leaked like this. So never before has there been an investigation like this.”<br></p>
<br>
<p>While Roberts indicated he has authorized the marshal of the Supreme Court to investigate the breach of Justice Samuel Alito’s draft opinion, he offered no details about how the inquiry would proceed. What's even less clear is whether the probe will include a criminal element. While Republicans called for federal prosecutors and the FBI to get involved, many legal experts said the disclosure, no matter how shocking, was unlikely to amount to a crime. Government leaks are rarely prosecuted, with the exception of unauthorized disclosures of classified information. The culprit would be likelier to face professional consequences, such as firing and disbarment rather than prosecution, they say.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the most urgent question is who will conduct the investigation. Roberts <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/press/pressreleases/pr_05-03-21" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;appointed the current&nbsp;marshal,&nbsp;Gail Curley&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/press/pressreleases/pr_05-03-21&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22f30004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22f30005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">appointed the current&nbsp;marshal,&nbsp;Gail Curley</a>, last year. She oversees a staff of 260 court employees, which includes the court’s police force, tasked with protecting the justices and grounds. But that internal police force has limited investigative capability. It's primarily geared toward overseeing operations within the Supreme Court building and providing physical security for justices, employees and visitors.</p>
<p>Curley could request assistance from the FBI, which has the resources to aid any internal probe. But that step itself would depend on how deeply the justices want another branch's investigators poking around into their private communications.<br></p>
<br><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6305557046112" frameborder="0"></iframe> 
<br>
<p>Some GOP lawmakers have already urged the FBI to get involved and interview anyone who likely had access to the draft. Senior Republicans on the House Oversight Committee wrote to Attorney General Merrick Garland on Tuesday seeking answers on “all potential laws violated by leaking a draft Supreme Court opinion during deliberations with the intent to threaten or intimidate members of the Court.” And former Attorney General William Barr told an interviewer Tuesday it may take a “grand jury” to identify the source of the breach.</p>
<p>“It could be obstructing the administration of justice, the due process of justice,” he said on SiriusXM's “The Megyn Kelly Show.”<br></p>
<br>
<p>Barr also floated the prospect that Roberts could appoint a former U.S. attorney or criminal law expert to lead a special internal investigation.</p>
<p>But any significant Justice Department involvement would involve problems with the constitutional separation of powers, raising the uncomfortable prospect of an executive branch agency rifling through the communications of Supreme Court justices and their closest aides.</p>
<p>The scope of the Roberts-authorized investigation is unknown. A probe of the small and clubby staff of the Supreme Court would put every justice in an uncomfortable position, exposing them to questions about their phone and email records in ways that justices are rarely, if ever, confronted. And any thorough investigation is likely to also sweep up the families and close associates of justices and clerks.</p>
<p>“If there’s a serious investigation of who leaked, am I right that it likely includes not only all the clerks and Court staff that would have access to the opinion, but also the Justices and their families?” <a href="https://twitter.com/OrinKerr/status/1521534882198994944" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1651628617513,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-7543-d47e-ab7e-fd73d7140000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1651628617513,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-7543-d47e-ab7e-fd73d7140000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/OrinKerr/status/1521534882198994944&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-8cbc-d337-a9cc-bebca92f0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;wondered Orin Kerr&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-8cbc-d337-a9cc-bebca92f0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">wondered Orin Kerr</a>, a law professor who has argued before the Supreme Court. “Could be pretty wide-ranging.”<br></p>

<p>Some legal experts noted that the circumstances surrounding the draft opinion’s disclosure — such as whether any money changed hands — would determine whether a criminal predicate exists. A spokesperson for POLITICO emphasized that the company did not and would not pay to obtain the document.</p>
<p>“POLITICO doesn’t pay for information or sources,” said spokesperson Brad Dayspring.</p>
<p>The discussion of a potential crime was the subject of debate among lawmakers Tuesday morning during a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing. When Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) suggested that the DOJ explore the disclosure of the draft opinion Tuesday, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) shot back that it was unclear what potential crime the department would be investigating.<br></p>

<p>The extraordinary disclosure of a draft Supreme Court opinion that would overturn <i>Roe v. Wade</i> is giving liberal legal advocates nightmares that go well beyond the right to abortion.</p>
<p>While relegating <i>Roe</i> to the dustbin of history would be painful enough for many on the left, a raft of legal commentators declared Tuesday that Alito’s initial draft in the pending case on Mississippi’s 15-week abortion ban could set off a series of other setbacks to victories dating all the way back to the 1960s in pivotal cases over individual rights.</p>
<p>Liberals now warn that gay marriage, contraception and other rights rooted in a long-established constitutional protection for privacy could be threatened, based on Alito’s writing and reasoning <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1651630731936,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014f-1289-d432-adcf-33c9e3110022&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1651630731936,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014f-1289-d432-adcf-33c9e3110022&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-8cdc-d7d2-adbc-fedee2b10001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;in the draft opinion&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-8cdc-d7d2-adbc-fedee2b10000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">in the draft opinion</a>.</p>
<p>“Take this seriously,” former U.S. Attorney Joyce White Vance wrote on Twitter. “If Roe falls, rights that are further up that branch of the tree are also vulnerable.”<br></p>

<br>
<p>Former Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) struck a similar note of alarm, warning that almost any right grounded in concerns about personal privacy was in jeopardy if an opinion like Alito’s becomes law.</p>
<p>“They kicked the ladder out from under the right of privacy in the Constitution,” McCaskill said on MSNBC. “There are a lot of decisions that rest on this right of privacy that springs not just from the Bill of Rights, but also the 14th Amendment and the concept of liberty in this country.”</p>

Bush appointee forcefully insisted that setting aside <i>Roe</i> wouldn’t impact any right other than abortion. The protections discussed in Alito’s opinion range from the right to same-sex marriage the high court declared in 2015 to the right to contraception established in 1965 to the right to engage in interracial marriage adopted by the court in 1967.</p>
<p>After citing 14 such cases, Alito declares them irrelevant to abortion and confidently asserts that yanking <i>Roe</i> from the fabric of American jurisprudence would pose no threat whatsoever to any of those rights.</p>
<p>“They do not support the right to obtain an abortion, and by the same token, our conclusion that the Constitution does not confer such a right does not undermine them in any way,” Alito writes in the draft opinion published by POLITICO on Monday.<br></p>

<p>But many on the left simply don’t buy that.

<p>“It would mean that every other decision relating to the notion of privacy is thrown into question,” Biden said in response to questions from reporters Tuesday, just after Chief Justice John Roberts <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/03/chief-justice-roberts-draft-abortion-opinion-00029593" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1651630768245,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014f-1289-d432-adcf-33c9e3110022&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1651630768245,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014f-1289-d432-adcf-33c9e3110022&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/03/chief-justice-roberts-draft-abortion-opinion-00029593&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-8cdd-d337-a9cc-bedd70990001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;issued a statement&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-8cdd-d337-a9cc-bedd70990000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">issued a statement</a> confirming the draft obtained by POLITICO is authentic.</p>
<p>“If the rationale of the decision as released were to be sustained, a whole range of rights are in question,” Biden added.</p>
<p>Biden specifically suggested that same-sex marriage could be again outlawed in some states if Alito’s view holds sway at the high court.</p>
<p>“Does this mean that in Florida they can decide they’re going to pass a law saying that same-sex marriage is not permissible, that it’s against the law in Florida?” the president said. “It’s a fundamental shift in American jurisprudence.”</p>
<p>Some court observers contend that Alito’s specific reasoning for dismantling <i>Roe </i>isn’t the only thing in the opinion that imperils other rights. Simply the act of overturning the 49-year-old precedent means that newer rights, like same-sex marriage, could meet the same fate.<br></p>
<br>
<p>“It’s both the reasoning and the very existence of this opinion that leave me completely unpersuaded that this majority would be willing to stop at <i>Roe,” </i>said University of Texas Law Professor Stephen Vladeck.</p>
<p>Vladeck also noted the recurring theme in Alito’s opinion that purported rights that aren’t firmly established in American traditions are inherently more suspect than those with a longer history.</p>
<p>“Even as the draft claims it’s limited to abortion, it’s focused on the pedigree of the right,” Vladeck said, adding that the same rationale “would apply in other contexts where the court has recognized other rights not sufficiently rooted in in American contemporary tradition to mollify the court.”</p>
<p>That would seem to put relatively recent decisions in the crosshairs, particularly <i>Obergefell v. Hodges</i>, the same-sex marriage ruling delivered just seven years ago.</p>
<p>However, some legal experts don’t think the slippery slope is all that slippery in practice because many of the rights Alito cites are no longer terribly controversial.<br></p>
<br>
<p>“There’s no national movement to overturn <i>Obergefell</i>,” said South Texas College of Law Professor Josh Blackman. “There is no jurisdiction in the country that wants to ban interracial marriage.”</p>
<p>Some analysts have dismissed the talk of sweeping impacts from overturning <i>Roe</i> as a classic “parade-of-horribles” argument — a tactic legal advocates use to argue that a decision will have effects that go far beyond the specific issue at hand. </p>
<p>In his draft, Alito seeks to preempt anticipated criticism from liberal justices by declaring that abortion “terminates ‘life or potential life’” and that none of the other rights cited involve such concerns. That may not be strictly true in the realm of contraception, but Alito proposes the court be explicit in declaring its ruling on abortion rights should never be construed to impact other protections.</p>
<p>“To ensure that our decision is not misunderstood or mischaracterized, we emphasize that our decision concerns the constitutional right to abortion and no other right,” Alito writes. “Nothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion.”</p>
<p>To some observers, that disclaimer is quite similar to the Supreme Court’s insistence in the case resolving the 2000 presidential election, <i>Bush v. Gore</i>, that the decision there was “limited to the present circumstances.”</p>
<p>Despite that caveat, lower courts have sometimes looked to the case for guidance. A couple of justices have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/brett-kavanaugh-bush-gore-wisconsin-election/2020/10/27/799fe8aa-1876-11eb-befb-8864259bd2d8_story.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;cited it in individual opinions&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/brett-kavanaugh-bush-gore-wisconsin-election/2020/10/27/799fe8aa-1876-11eb-befb-8864259bd2d8_story.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22f80000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd22f80001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">cited it in individual opinions</a>, although the court has yet to do so in a majority opinion.</p>
<p>While the chance of a post-<i>Roe</i> court going on a rampage against contraception or endorsing fresh bans on interracial marriage seem low, the implicit green light offered by overturning the half-century-old abortion decision could be too tempting for some state lawmakers to refuse.</p>
<p>“It’s a theoretical concern for the moment but I live in Texas and it’s not hard to imagine the Texas Legislature not being shy when it comes to pushing the envelope,” Vladeck said. “What a ruling like this does is get all of these politicians in red states to think: ‘What haven’t we done because we thought we couldn’t?’”</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In the 23 hours after POLITICO reported a draft Supreme Court opinion that would overturn <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, ActBlue took in just $9 million — just a small uptick from the days prior.</p>
<p>The modest totals, which reached $12 million by midnight on Tuesday, based on a POLITICO analysis of the ActBlue donation tracker, are an early sign that Democrats can’t count on abortion to single-handedly turn around a midterm cycle that’s already trending badly for them. Interviews with more than a dozen Democratic pollsters and strategists Tuesday detailed a scramble within the party to parse how the seismic disclosure might affect base enthusiasm and reshape messaging ahead of the midterms — now that a theoretical threat has become real.<br></p>
<br>
<p>There is broad consensus that a ruling overturning <i>Roe</i> would help Democrats in some districts, potentially reducing their losses by drawing in suburban women who backed them in 2018. But few believe it would be enough to offset the brutal midterm environment and President Joe Biden’s sagging approval ratings.</p>
<p>One Democratic pollster, granted anonymity to discuss the issue candidly, acknowledged that the issue “will help at the margins,” but “to hold the House or Senate, we need inflation to go away.”</p>
<p>It’s also opening up a debate within the party about how much to lean into abortion as an animating message for the base, rather than focusing primarily on cost of living and job growth.</p>
<p>“Midterm voters care about affordability first and foremost, and they are not people who are worried every single day about losing access to abortion,” said Julie Roginsky, a Democratic strategist who began her career as a researcher at the abortion rights group EMILY’s List. “My fear continues to be that sometimes we as Democrats run on things that we wish the voters cared about, rather than what the voters do care about.”<br></p>

<p>“Is this something they lose sleep over every night?” she added. “No. What they do lose sleep over is, ‘I can’t fill up my gas tank, it’s really expensive. I can’t afford to send my kid to college, it’s really expensive.’ … Any voter who will vote purely based on [<i>Roe</i>] is an incredibly committed voter who will be coming out in the midterms, anyway.”</p>

<p>But several Democratic pollsters and strategists noted that the party is still flying blind about what the reaction might be among voters. That's because private polling showed they were skeptical that the Supreme Court would actually take this step. One pollster described how Democratic candidates would ask to “test for this scenario,” but “you can’t test for it until it happens,” the person said.</p>
<p>Jessica Floyd, president of American Bridge, a super PAC focused on activating female voters, said the group’s research in December found that a majority of voters supported <i>Roe v. Wade</i>. And they didn’t believe the Supreme Court would overrule it.</p>
<p>“What’s changed is that Republicans went through with their long-standing plans, which voters thought were protected,” she said. “The sound you’re hearing is a million phones ringing, as every group is digging into what this means because everything’s now changed.”</p>
<p>One problem for Democrats seeking to capitalize on the potential demise of <i>Roe</i> is that so much of the party’s base resides in heavily Democratic states where abortion is protected — and where Democrats were already moving to enact more stringent protections.</p>

<p>Several Democrats warned that it may take some time for the implications of the draft opinion to hit voters, but “once everyone knows this … is real and understands the ramifications of it, then it will drive mobilization,” said Stephanie Schriock, the former president of EMILY’s List. “Folks are still digesting this, and it’s not clear what it means for them … our side is going to have to put it up on TV, direct mail, on radio and on digital ads.” </p>

<p>“If they act on that anger by voting, it could make a difference in some close races,” Axelrod said in an email, calling the political dynamics surrounding the draft opinion “uncharted waters.”</p>
<p>Democrats are taking the Republican Party’s reaction to the disclosure — in which the GOP is focusing primarily on the disclosure of the draft opinion, not the substance — as an indication that Republicans are fearful of a backlash. One Democrat working on races in the Southwest said Republicans “know it’s a political killer for them,” and that “in a morbid way, it’s the first ray of sunshine this cycle.”<br></p>

<p>But there is also a fear among Democrats that putting <i>Roe</i> on the ballot could motivate Republicans as much as Democrats in November, and potentially cut into the party’s support among socially conservative Latinos.</p>
<p>The disclosure of the draft opinion also changed the timing of the <i>Roe</i> debate, potentially with negative consequences for Democrats. Even before the draft was reported, Democrats bullish on the political effects of <i>Roe</i> being overturned feared a June release of the decision might come too soon to help them in November. The disclosure pushed the Democratic outrage earlier in the calendar, with six months before the elections.</p>
<p>One Democratic strategist said Tuesday that it’s possible a court ruling against <i>Roe&nbsp;</i>will “light a fire under" their voters; Democrats “haven’t seen abortion as a working message for quite some time.”</p>
<p>The strategist added: “I just don’t see how this isn’t a bloodbath for Dems.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Few Republican lawmakers on Tuesday were celebrating a draft Supreme Court opinion that would overturn <i>Roe v. Wade</i>. Instead, they were angrily demanding answers to how the document became public in the first place.</p>
<p>GOP leaders trained their fire on the breach of Supreme Court protocol that led to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1651594838940,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-8dd1-d850-a57f-ddd5fa8d0007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1651594838940,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-8dd1-d850-a57f-ddd5fa8d0007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-8ab9-d7d2-adbc-febb3c240000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;POLITICO’s publication of the draft opinion&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-8ab9-d7d2-adbc-febb3c230000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">POLITICO’s publication of the draft opinion</a> by the court’s conservative majority<i>, </i>with only a handful of Republicans cheering the substance of the document itself even though the GOP has long opposed <i>Roe.</i></p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who played a significant role in shaping the makeup of the current court, repeatedly declined to comment on the draft opinion itself or claim credit for the likely end of federally protected abortion rights. Rather, he focused on what he sees as an effort to undermine the court.</p>
<p>“I think the story today is an effort by someone on the inside to discredit the institution,” McConnell said, comparing it to proposals by some Democrats to expand the Supreme Court and impose term limits on justices. “All of this puts the cart before the horse ... Concentrate on what the news is today — not a leaked draft, but the fact that the draft was leaked.”<br></p>
<br><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6305568083112" frameborder="0"></iframe> 
<br>
<p>On Tuesday morning, Chief Justice John Roberts confirmed the draft’s authenticity — emphasizing that it was not a final opinion — and said he had ordered the marshal of the Supreme Court to investigate the “betrayal of confidence.”</p>
<p>Though little is publicly known about how the draft opinion came to light — or who might benefit most from its disclosure — some Republicans portrayed it as a breach by a progressive clerk or justice hoping to marshal public pressure against the five justices linked to the document. It’s the latest in a string of Republican accusations about the sources of breaches in high-profile matters, including politically charged congressional and criminal probes.</p>
<p>Republicans who have long hoped the court would repeal <i>Roe</i>’s establishment of abortion rights demanded investigations, firings and even prosecutions for the breach.<br></p>
<br>
<p>“We don’t know exactly what the opinion is going to say. And right now my focus is on finding the person who leaked it, making sure they’re investigated, held accountable and had their career, and everything involving [it], done,” said Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.). “That’s all I’m talking about today.”</p>
<p>House Republican leaders similarly said in a statement that the disclosure was “an attempt to severely damage” the court and part of a “clearly coordinated campaign to intimidate and obstruct the justices.” McConnell said “the Department of Justice must pursue criminal charges if applicable.”</p>
<p>Authored by conservative Justice Samuel Alito, an appointee of George W. Bush, the draft opinion amounted to an unsparing rejection of Roe. Some legal scholars pointed out that it would raise significant questions about a slew of other Supreme Court precedents.</p>
<p>The breach of a draft opinion is an unprecedented departure from the norms on the normally airtight court, which has stood out among government institutions as relatively impervious to unauthorized disclosures even in tumultuous times.</p>
<p>“We’re about to find out what our Department of Justice is made of,” Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said Tuesday, though it wasn’t clear that a law was broken. “We have had an unprecedented leak. As despicable as it is dangerous.”</p>

<p>Hawley, who spoke at the Senate GOP lunch on Tuesday, was among the few Republicans actually cheering<b> </b>the<b> </b>contents of Alito’s draft. He said it was “voluminously researched, tightly argued, and morally powerful.”</p>
<p>Democrats largely took an inverse approach, acknowledging concerns about the breach but pivoting quickly to the details of the opinion. They argued that their GOP colleagues’ laser focus on the disclosure itself is an acknowledgment that Republicans’ views on abortion are unpopular with voters.<br></p>

<br>
<p>“Republicans are spending all their focus on the leak because they don’t want to focus on <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, where they know they’re on the wrong side of history and on the wrong side of the American people,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said.</p>
<p>If the conservative majority affirms its substance in a matter of weeks, when the court officially is set to release its final ruling, many in President Joe Biden’s party warned that the loss of abortion rights would create widespread fear and chaos.</p>
<p>“I don’t condone the leaking of internal Supreme Court documents. Senator Kennedy’s correct; it is unprecedented,” said Senate Judiciary Chair Dick Durbin (D-Ill.). “I don’t know who leaked the opinion or why. But I know today women and men across this country are grappling with the real concern and the fear that they can lose a critical constitutional right in a matter of weeks.”</p>
<p>Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) sharply rejected Durbin’s position.</p>
<p>“To suggest that the true injury here is that inflicted by this opinion gets it completely, 180 degrees backward,” he said, saying it’s urgent to “protect and defend the legitimacy of the court” regardless of views on its individual decisions.</p>
<p>Many on the left speculated that POLITICO’s story would in fact benefit those seeking to overturn <i>Roe</i> because it would harden the position of the four justices reported to have joined Alito’s opinion: Brett Kavanaugh, Neil Gorsuch, Amy Coney Barrett and Clarence Thomas. But neither Democrats nor Republicans opining about the breach suggested they knew the identity of the person who disclosed the draft opinion. </p>
<p>And in the absence of evidence, GOP lawmakers hammered on the unproven assumption that the breach was orchestrated by the left in a bid to intimidate conservative justices to back off their opinion.<br></p>

<p>Republicans have long decried breaches of information in high-profile matters, often presuming the sources without direct evidence. For example, during Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election — when his team of prosecutors almost never commented on their work — Republican lawmakers often accused his team of leaks.</p>
<p>Kennedy, speaking at a Judiciary Committee hearing on judicial ethics Tuesday morning, called on the FBI to investigate every person who had access to the draft.</p>
<p>His comments prompted Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) to note that such a probe would raise significant separation of powers concerns — with executive branch agents interviewing “clerks and staff and justices themselves.” Kennedy said the Supreme Court’s own police force could partner with the FBI to mitigate those concerns.</p>
<p>Whitehouse also wondered, pointedly, what law the so-called leaker could be investigated for violating.</p>

<p>But the reality confronting most Democrats is there isn’t much they can do before the final ruling comes down.</p>
<p>Most states have finished, or are nearly finished, with their legislative sessions and have little power to stop abortion from soon becoming illegal in roughly half the country. Nascent efforts to establish abortion funds to help pregnant people travel to states where the procedure is still legal are only now being drafted. And the evenly divided U.S. Senate has repeatedly failed to advance abortion protections and lacks the votes to do so.</p>
<p>With lawmakers stymied, much of the abortion-rights response is expected to fall to medical and activist groups that are opening abortion clinics near airports and on state borders, setting up channels to distribute abortion pills in states that have banned them or are planning to do so, and raising millions to help patients travel out of state for the procedure.</p>
<p>Democratic officials on Tuesday didn’t articulate a clear strategy for bills or executive actions to shore up abortion rights ahead of the expected June ruling, but rather highlighted the need to harness the outrage to turn out voters in November.</p>
<p>“What happened last night, I am pissed. I am furious,” Kansas state Rep. Christina Haswood said at a Washington, D.C., event on Tuesday. “We can be angry, but we really need your help coming up this election.”</p>

<p>The focus on the midterms is a tacit admission that while Democrats hold power — controlling the White House, both chambers of Congress, 22 governors’ mansions and 18 state legislatures — they remain unable in much of the country to meaningfully protect abortion rights.</p>

<p>“Seeing it in black and white is different than being warned for years and decades,” said Elizabeth Nash, interim associate director of state issues at the Guttmacher Institute. “It’s not unexpected, but it’s a gut punch nonetheless.”</p>
<p>Now, with significant government action unlikely, many Democrats are voicing frustration that their own colleagues and the public didn’t mobilize earlier to enact greater protections.</p>

<p>Because the closely divided Congress has long been unable to pass new abortion restrictions or protections, many progressive advocates said Tuesday that they are instead depending on state and local officials to take action before the Supreme Court issues its final ruling.</p>
<p>“Days like today, kind of feels like the hope is in the states, doesn't it?” Emily Cain, the executive director of EMILY’s List, said at the group’s annual conference. “As we think about the governors and state legislatures … we're going to help to make sure they are there to hold the line for women's reproductive freedom.”</p>
<p>But instead of announcing new ambitious policies to protect access to abortion in the wake of Monday’s news, many Democratic governors in swing states up for reelection this year — including Whitmer, Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak and Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers — framed themselves as the only thing standing between their constituents and restrictive abortion laws.</p>
<p>Several passed the baton back to Congress, writing a letter to Democratic leadership Tuesday afternoon that called on the Senate to take action to codify <i>Roe</i> into law.</p>
<p>“It is imperative that Congress acts swiftly to ensure that all Americans continue to have meaningful access to reproductive healthcare and abortion,” the governors wrote in a letter first shared with POLITICO.</p>
<p>Of the 21 states with Democratic governors, a third have already wrapped up their legislative sessions or didn’t meet this year. And many of those states still in legislative session — including Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and Kansas — have GOP-majority Legislatures not interested in protecting abortion rights.<br></p>
<br>
<p>Not all states have been idle, though.</p>
<p>California passed a set of bills to extend legal protections both to state residents and patients coming in from other parts of the country, extend financial assistance to people seeking abortions and better fund the clinics and staff performing the procedure.</p>
<p>New York State Democrats are <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2021/S758?source=email" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;pushing a bill&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2021/S758?source=email&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd2306000c&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd2306000d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">pushing a bill</a> to establish an abortion access fund, which would be paid for by state taxpayers through a voluntary contribution on their personal income tax returns.</p>
<p>Oregon established a $15 million Reproductive Health Equity Fund, Maryland and Connecticut passed legislation allowing nurse practitioners and physician assistants to perform abortions and Colorado approved a Reproductive Health Equity Act ensuring that pregnant people in the state have the right to choose their own pregnancy outcomes.</p>
<p>Nash, of the Guttmacher Institute, said while she supports enacting statutory protections for abortion where possible, there are other actions states can take to increase access to abortion, including helping to expand the number of abortion providers and clinics in their states, requiring health insurance plans to cover abortion and directly allocating state dollars to help fund abortion-related travel.</p>
<p>States “need to put their money where their mouth is because patients need them,” she said.</p>
<p>Yet with most states unable to meaningfully protect millions of women who will soon be subject to sweeping abortion restrictions, medical and activist groups are filling the void.</p>
<p>Whole Woman’s Health and Planned Parenthood are opening abortion clinics near airports and on state borders to receive travelers from states expected to swiftly ban abortion.

<p>“Abortion funds exist and have always existed to fill a gap that should be filled by a basic social safety net from our government,” Debasri Ghosh, the managing director of National Network of Abortion Funds, told POLITICO.</p>
<p>Ghosh’s group received such a massive flood of donations Monday night that their site crashed, though by Tuesday it had been restored. She said that while the draft opinion was “gutting,” it was what she expected and groups like hers aren’t going to wait on the government to respond.</p>
<p>“People even with <i>Roe</i> intact haven’t had meaningful access to abortion,” she said. “That is literally why we exist. And we know the need has been increasing and will continue to increase.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Supreme Court’s draft majority opinion striking down <i>Roe v. Wade </i>couldn't have happened without Mitch McConnell.</p>
<p>There’s a direct line from the Senate minority leader's decision to hold a high court vacancy open in 2016 to the potential demise of <i>Roe</i> six years later. McConnell’s blockade of Merrick Garland, the Obama Supreme Court nominee who's now attorney general, set the stage for a 6-3 conservative majority where Chief Justice John Roberts is no longer the swing vote on contentious issues such as abortion access. </p>
<p>But that's not to say McConnell is taking credit for the Supreme Court’s place on the precipice of overturning five-decade-old precedent.</p>
<p>At Tuesday's private Republican Party lunch, he told his members to concentrate on the breach of the draft opinion in their responses, particularly if they felt uncomfortable with addressing the substance of Justice Samuel Alito's document, according to four attendees. And in public remarks afterward, McConnell distanced his longstanding push to reshape the federal judiciary from the future of <i>Roe</i>.</p>
<p>Yet his allies said that there’s no way <i>Roe v. Wade </i>would be in imminent danger without a series of decisions McConnell made over roughly a decade reflecting his single-minded focus on installing a conservative judicial majority. Stopping Garland and installing Justice Neil Gorsuch kept the court from tilting to the liberals. And installing Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett cemented a court almost sure to be hostile to abortion rights.</p>
<p>“Republicans confirmed three very solid conservative justices,” said Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), the No. 3 GOP leader. “It was Mitch McConnell’s ability that put us in a position to have three openings.”</p>
<p>During his Trump-era drive to remake the courts, confirming <a href="https://judiciarytracker.com/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1651610676836,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-8dd1-d850-a57f-ddd5fa8d0007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1651610676836,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-8dd1-d850-a57f-ddd5fa8d0007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://judiciarytracker.com/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-8baa-d337-a9cc-bbaae8d10001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;more than 230 judicial nominees&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-8baa-d337-a9cc-bbaae8d10000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">more than 230 judicial nominees</a> over four years, the Senate Republican leader didn’t exactly emphasize that his goal was to strike down the 1973 <i>Roe</i> decision. Yet his use of hard-nosed tactics that predecessors might have flinched at, from blocking then-President Barack Obama's appointee to installing Barrett just days before the 2020 election, left little chance at another outcome.</p>
<p>In some ways, McConnell was able to hack the traditional system for wielding congressional power. By focusing on the judiciary during his six years as majority leader, four of them alongside former President Donald Trump, he achieved what he never could have through legislation — without having to budge from his opposition to killing the legislative filibuster.</p>
<p>Most Senate Republicans stuck by the 60-vote threshold required to pass most bills even when their party controlled Washington, a stance that helped the Democratic minority regularly block GOP efforts to restrict abortion rights. But McConnell didn't need to focus on abortion legislation to achieve his goal. </p>
<p>Rather than mount a laborious effort to secure the votes to change Senate rules and restrict abortion access, he instead focused on unifying his conference around presidential nominees. During his time as GOP leader, McConnell has suggested that he's found it’s far more effective to confirm appointees with simple majorities than try to enact change through the messy legislative process. </p>

<p>“McConnell prepared for this with his refusal to fill the vacancy of Scalia. It was by design an effort to make sure that this day would come,” said Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) of <i>Roe</i>. “It’s exactly what he wanted. More than anything else, this was the trademark decision for the modern Trump party.”</p>
<p>Durbin was among the Democrats agog at McConnell’s refusal to take credit Tuesday for conservatives’ long-sought goal of overturning <i>Roe</i>. And not everyone in the GOP is ready to give it up for McConnell. </p>
<p>“Why would he get any credit?" Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) said. "Did he nominate the judges? I’d give the credit to the guy who nominated the judges.”<br></p>
<br>
<img src="https://static.politico.com/4b/52/48cd7bb54c0bb5bff8d16f6cca61/chung.KBJJudiciaryCommittee_015.jpg">
<br>
<p>“Donald Trump is what gives us this possibility. Without him saying he’s going to nominate pro-life judges, we wouldn't have pro-life judges on the bench,” said Hawley, who more overtly pushed for judges with anti-abortion positions than most other GOP senators. “There’s been a lot of Republicans who nominated Republican judges who would not overturn <i>Roe</i>.”</p>
<p>At one time when he was aligned with Trump, McConnell was a celebrated figure in the GOP. Some Republicans even credit his 2016 Garland blockade with making Trump president, arguing it galvanized conservatives around a candidate once seen as shaky on abortion.</p>
<p>But ever since McConnell harshly criticized Trump’s conduct on Jan. 6, Trump has repeatedly sought to oust him as Senate Republican leader. It's been an unsuccessful endeavor: Senate Republicans almost uniformly trust McConnell's leadership, particularly because of how he held his position to stymie Garland under immense pressure from Democrats and a handful of Republicans.</p>
<p>“Mitch’s leadership on this issue has been a game-changer,” said Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.).</p>
<p>On Tuesday at lunch, McConnell invited Hawley and Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas), all former Supreme Court clerks, to discuss how tightly held its draft opinions are. Summing up McConnell’s message to the conference, one attendee said: “If you're not comfortable talking about what's going on, talk about the egregious leak.”</p>
<p>McConnell insisted to reporters afterward the “story” of the day was not the substance of the draft opinion, but that it had become public at all.</p>
<p>“You need, it seems to me, a lecture to concentrate on what the news is today. Not a leaked draft, but the fact that the draft was leaked,” McConnell said when asked if he will seek to pass new federal abortion restriction if <i>Roe</i> is struck down.</p>
<p>Those remarks brought a stern rejoinder from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer: “Republicans sought this outcome for years. You’d think they’d be celebrating. A few are, the real hard-right fanatics. But not Leader McConnell.”</p>
<p>McConnell’s focus on the disclosure of the draft opinion by Alito showed that Republicans aren’t ready to own the end of <i>Roe</i> just yet. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) downplayed the idea that Republicans will pass federal abortion bans whenever they are back in power: “There will be proposals like that. I think that what we ought to be doing though is walking the talk in terms of leaving this to the states to decide.”<br></p>
<br>
<p>McConnell’s focus all along has been “trying to make sure that we do not fill the bench with activists," Tillis said.</p>
<p>At first, though, the GOP leader made sure some seats on the bench weren’t filled at all.</p>
<p>McConnell led Senate Republicans to filibuster Obama’s circuit court picks in 2013, votes that eventually motivated Democrats to do away with the filibuster for presidential nominees — leaving only an exception for the Supreme Court.

<p>Senate Democratic leaders pledged Tuesday to soon vote to protect abortion rights in the wake of a disclosed draft of a Supreme Court majority opinion to possibly overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. But it's going nowhere — just ask members of their own party.</p>
<p>Facing yet another existential challenge in President Joe Biden’s presidency, Democrats are confronting the same problems that have stymied much of their agenda for the last year and a half: slim majorities and lacking the votes to change Senate rules.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court’s draft opinion — while not official — has caused a political earthquake in Washington, with Democratic leaders calling it the greatest legal threat in the U.S. in decades. However, the stubborn dynamics of the Senate appear unshaken so far, with multiple Democratic senators such as Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who personally opposes abortion rights, holding strong on their support for the 60-vote threshold.</p>
<p>And unless that changes, Democrats acknowledge they're left with one main option: Attempting to defy the odds and win more power in the midterms.<br></p>

<br>
<p>“It’s uphill, there’s no question that it’s an ongoing fight,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.). “But this prospect of reversing Roe vs. Wade is no longer some abstract or hypothetical thing in the future … Countless women are feeling afraid, alone, anguished and angry. And they’re going to be voting. And we need more senators who are pro-choice.”</p>
<p>The push for another floor vote was widely expected after POLITICO reported on Monday night about the court’s draft opinion. But the Senate failed to advance <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_117_HR_3755" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1651764690487,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000157-fd3b-d94e-a1d7-fd7f9bd90000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1651764690487,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000157-fd3b-d94e-a1d7-fd7f9bd90000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_117_HR_3755&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-94d8-d337-a9cc-bed8f15b0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;similar Roe legislation&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-94d8-d337-a9cc-bed8f15b0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">similar Roe legislation</a> in February — despite the party base's eagerness to act on abortion rights.

<p>“It’s a different world now, the tectonic plates of our politics, on women’s choice and on women’s rights in general are changing,” Schumer said. “Every senator now, under the real glare of <i>Roe v. Wade</i> repealed by the courts, is going to have to show which side they’re on. And we will find the best way to go forward after that.” </p>
<p>He added that he hasn’t looked at <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_117_S_3713" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3270-d4f3-a3cb-f3ffa8610000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1651764739863,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000157-fd3b-d94e-a1d7-fd7f9bd90000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1651764739863,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000157-fd3b-d94e-a1d7-fd7f9bd90000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_117_S_3713&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-94d9-d7d2-adbc-fedbb1fe0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;legislation&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-94d9-d7d2-adbc-fedbb1fd0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">legislation</a> introduced by Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) that would also codify <i>Roe. </i>Murkowski, who said the draft opinion "rocks my confidence in the court right now," commented Tuesday that she thought the Senate should consider their bill.</p>
<p>The looming floor vote is renewing calls from progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) to nix the legislative filibuster, even as Manchin and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) reiterated that they still support the 60-vote requirement. Sinema doubled down on her position Tuesday, arguing that the filibuster has protected women's access to health care "half-a-dozen times in the past ten years."</p>
<p>Still, Sanders said the Senate should “absolutely” hold another rules change vote, even without full support from the Democratic caucus, declaring that “the American people have a right to know how their senators feel about that issue, an issue about whether women are going to lose fundamental rights they've had for 50 years.”</p>
<p>While the Senate is expected to vote on legislation to codify <i>Roe,</i> Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) suggested that they instead should vote on a simpler Senate resolution that could unify all 50 members of the caucus. Manchin voted against moving forward on legislation to codify <i>Roe</i> in February. </p>
<p>“If there’s something that will get all 50 votes, why put something on the floor that won’t?” Kaine asked. </p>
<p>With Democrats’ current options in Congress limited, the party increasingly views its best hope on abortion rights as galvanizing liberal voters — particularly women — ahead of the midterm elections and expanding their fragile majorities.</p>
<p>“<i>Roe v. Wade</i> has been on the ballot for many on the far right for years,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). “I think in 2022, it’s going to be on the ballot for the rest of America.”</p>
<p>Several House Democrats are already calling for more floor votes on abortion, even if the legislation lacks a path forward in the Senate.</p>
<p>“I would certainly favor doing it again to make the point that what the Supreme Court has done is disgusting,” House Rules chair Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) said in an interview Tuesday. “I think their view of the future is something out of ‘The Handmaid’s Tale.’”</p>
<p>Teeing up more votes in the House, Democrats argue, will also underscore to voters how seriously they take abortion rights ahead of November.</p>
<p>“For all the talk in the past that <i>Roe vs. Wade</i> was on the chopping block, a lot of people said, ‘Oh, that’s never going to happen. The Supreme Court will never overturn that.’ But it’s real. It’s happening,” McGovern said.</p>
<p>Biden also seemed to acknowledge the uphill nature of legislative action. In a statement Tuesday morning, Biden said at the federal level, “we will need more pro-choice Senators and a pro-choice majority in the House to adopt legislation that codifies Roe.”</p>

<p>The sprawling architecture of the Kharkiv State Academic Opera and Ballet Theater was once a sight to behold. Large posters of upcoming performances adorned the exterior walls and vibrant rose arrangements decorated tall water fountains on a symmetrical gray plaza. Inside, event goers would be ushered from a cathedral of art-filled walls into vast halls that could seat nearly 2,000 people.</p>
<p>But severe Russian shelling killed 10 people and disintegrated the building into rubble. The theater is not the only cultural landmark destroyed. Since the invasion began Feb. 24, UNESCO has registered at least 120 instances of damage or complete destruction of cultural sites, including museums, historic buildings, libraries and religious institutions.</p>
<p>The Cultural Heritage Monitoring Lab, a collaborative monitoring project between the Virginia Museum of Natural History and the Smithsonian Cultural Rescue Initiative, <a href="https://www.vmnh.net/content/vmnh/uploads/PDFs/research_and_collections/chml/22-0407_ukrainian_cultural_heritage_potential_impact_summary_final2.pdf" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;estimates damage to 191 sites&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.vmnh.net/content/vmnh/uploads/PDFs/research_and_collections/chml/22-0407_ukrainian_cultural_heritage_potential_impact_summary_final2.pdf&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd230f0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd230f0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">estimates damage to 191 sites</a> from the beginning of the invasion to April 2. In April alone, UNESCO recorded more than 50 Russian attacks on heritage sites.</p>
<p>Damage has become so widespread that some experts believe the sites are being targeted deliberately, putting the architecture of Ukraine’s identity at risk. They’re calling on the U.N. and U.S. government to protect and promote Ukraine’s cultural identity before it’s too late.</p>
<p>“In addition to a purely conventional military attack, Russia knows it to be more strategic to target Ukrainian culture with the primary aim of it being destroyed,” said Yuri Shevchuk, a lexicographer and lecturer of Ukrainian language at Columbia University. “They know that even if Ukraine wins, but Ukrainian culture loses and Ukrainian language disappears, there will be no Ukraine.”</p>
<p>It is against international law to intentionally<b> </b>target cultural heritage and property in war, according to the 1954 Hague Convention. Since Russia and Ukraine are among the 133 signatories, the damage to Ukraine’s cultural institutions could become evidence in a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/13/war-crimes-russia-ukraine-00024860" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;potential war crimes case&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/13/war-crimes-russia-ukraine-00024860&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd230f0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd230f0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">potential war crimes case</a>.</p>
<p>“Ukraine is a country well known for its rich history, the place where cultures from the East and West joined,” Lazare Eloundou Assomo, director of UNESCO World Heritage Centre, told POLITICO. “We are seriously concerned because Ukraine is losing not only an important part of its cultural heritage, but also its identity. A piece of themselves and a piece of history is going to disappear if the war doesn’t stop.”</p>
<p>In a March letter to Moscow, which was obtained by POLITICO, UNESCO chief Audrey Azoulay urged Russia to abide by the 1954 treaty.</p>
<p>“The need to ensure this protection results from the commitments made by the Russian Federation under the 1954 Convention and other relevant norms of international humanitarian law,” Azoulay said in the letter. “Any violation of these standards will engage the international responsibility of its authors.”</p>
<p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov responded that Moscow was aware of its obligations under the treaty and remains committed to them, a spokesperson at UNESCO said.<br></p>
<br><iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6305622549112" frameborder="0"></iframe> 
<br>
<p>There are seven UNESCO World Heritage sites in Ukraine, including St. Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv, Lviv’s entire historic city district and the Struve Geodetic Arc. In the letter to Lavrov, Azoulay notes that coordinates for the heritage sites have been attached separately — while already available online — with some properties distinctively marked with the United Nations’ “Blue Shield” emblem.</p>
<p>None of the World Heritage sites in Ukraine have so far been damaged.</p>
<p>Whether the attacks are indiscriminate or targeted, the consequences of losing cultural heritage could be dire. Cultural centers such as the Mariupol Museum and the Makarivska Public Library in Kyiv that contain unique art and literature have been destroyed. Historic buildings and monuments dedicating Ukraine’s fight against Nazism in World War II, including the Drobitsky Yar Holocaust Memorial, have been damaged.</p>
<p>Despite several months of shelling, Eloundou explained that UNESCO is still in its preliminary assessment phase, which the organization describes as cross-checking reported incidents with credible sources. When completed, UNESCO will be “fully ready to cooperate” with the International Criminal Court and other judicial institutions and plans to produce and share a final assessment “as appropriate,” Eloundou said.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time Russia has attacked antiquities in recent history.

This not only led to the destruction of heritage and museums being looted of ancient artifacts, but it created a path for relics to be directed out of the Middle East.</p>
<p>“There might be acts of wars that would destroy areas [and] there was a concern about looting,” said Elizabeth Repko, a director in the U.S. Government Accountability Office’s<b> </b>physical infrastructure team who worked on a <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-16-673.pdf" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;2016 report&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-16-673.pdf&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd230f0008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd230f0009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">2016 report</a> analyzing the U.S. response to the protection of cultural property in Iraq and Syria. “One of the concerns of looting was not just that ISIS may sell the cultural property and it could finance terrorism but also that there could be trafficking of stolen art into the United States.”</p>
<p>Much like what happened in the Middle East seems to already be in motion in Ukraine. The mayor of Melitopol said that Russian agents had conducted <a href="https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-society/3470870-melitopol-mayor-says-occupiers-steal-scythian-gold-collection-from-local-museum.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;a heist of ancient gold&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-society/3470870-melitopol-mayor-says-occupiers-steal-scythian-gold-collection-from-local-museum.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd230f000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd230f000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">a heist of ancient gold</a> from the Scythian empire and other artifacts from a local museum. In Mariupol, officials reported Russian agents breaking into a museum to steal highly valued artifacts, paintings and art pieces.</p>
<p>It would take five years after the assault on cultural artifacts began in Syria for the U.S. to pass the Protect and Preserve International Cultural Property Act in 2016, a law that created an interagency coordinating committee known as the Cultural Heritage Coordinating Committee, led by the Cultural Heritage Center within the State Department. While the 2016 law explicitly protects Syrian antiquities, the creation of the committee has given the State Department jurisdiction to address and prevent cultural destruction in Ukraine and other regions under threat.</p>
<p>There is no proposed legislation in Congress to protect Ukrainian cultural property. And it’s unclear whether the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/28/ukraine-funding-request-congress-biden-00028552" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;Biden administration’s recent $33 billion Ukraine request&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/28/ukraine-funding-request-congress-biden-00028552&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd230f000c&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd230f000d&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">Biden administration’s recent $33 billion Ukraine request</a> includes funding to save heritage sites.</p>
<p>In a recent news briefing, Cultural Heritage Center director Eric Catalfamo said it is “impossible” to know how many buildings, memorials and monuments have been destroyed or damaged in Ukraine.</p>
<p>“If we look back over a period of years, even before Russia's 2022 war against Ukraine, we know that Russia illegally exported artifacts from Crimea, and took them for display in Russia,” Catalfamo said.</p>
<p>He added that Russia “conducted unauthorized archaeological expeditions, demolished Muslim burial sites and damaged cultural heritage sites.”</p>
<p>For now, the center has been conducting remote monitoring and tracking, a State Department official told POLITICO. But experts on Ukraine say time is running out to protect Ukraine’s culture amid intense Russian bombardment.</p>
<p>“Culture is as powerful a weapon as a 155-millimeter Howitzer or a cruise missile,” Shevchuk said. “The difference is that culture has much longer-lasting consequences, and it is projected much farther.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

<br>
<p>KYIV — One by one, the mourners gathered at the gilded St. Michael’s cathedral, flowers in one hand and crossing themselves with the other, to pay their respects to Vira Hyrych.</p>
<p>Hyrych, a journalist for the U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s Ukrainian service, was killed on April 28, when a Russian cruise missile crashed into her apartment in central Kyiv, shattering the lives of hundreds who resided in the 25-story building and reminding residents of this city that any semblance of normalcy that they may have felt since Vladimir Putin’s military retreated from the capital last month was just an illusion.</p>
<p>Hyrych’s body was recovered from the smoldering pile of rubble the next day. The attack occurred during the visit of U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres, who had been in Moscow the day before to meet face-to-face with Putin in the Kremlin.</p>
<p>Hyrych, the seventh journalist killed since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began on Feb. 24, was laid to rest May 3, on World Press Freedom Day. <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/mariupol-ukraine-holocaust-russia-vira-hyrych/31831019.html?fbclid=IwAR15Skpf4Bl6kkOojDucyLMjNSzqo_6654ZpZAoxvj1XB5KRjNiEIyoEZII" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;<u>Her last story</u>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.rferl.org/a/mariupol-ukraine-holocaust-russia-vira-hyrych/31831019.html?fbclid=IwAR15Skpf4Bl6kkOojDucyLMjNSzqo_6654ZpZAoxvj1XB5KRjNiEIyoEZII&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd23120001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd23120002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><u>Her last story</u></a> was published posthumously: It was about an 87-year-old woman who survived the Holocaust, the Nazi siege of Leningrad, and now the Russian bombing of Mariupol, which she said was worse than anything she previously experienced.</p>
<p>Russian forces have pulled back from areas around Kyiv after a month-long occupation, but they left death and destruction on a horrendous scale. The bodies of 1,202 civilians have been found scattered and buried in mass graves around the region, Kyiv Regional Police Chief Andriy Nebytov <a href="https://english.nv.ua/nation/1-202-murdered-people-found-in-kyiv-oblast-as-result-of-russian-ukraine-war-50238703.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;<u>reportedly said</u>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://english.nv.ua/nation/1-202-murdered-people-found-in-kyiv-oblast-as-result-of-russian-ukraine-war-50238703.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd23120003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd23120004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><u>reportedly said</u></a> during a Ukrainian TV interview on May 2. He said the true death toll is likely much higher. The Prosecutor General’s Office has opened cases on 9,602 crimes of aggression and war crimes.</p>
<p>If some residents who fled in the early days of the invasion thought they could return to the safety of their homes to resume their lives, the attack on Kyiv that took Hyrych’s life was a stark reminder that even with Russian troops hundreds of miles to the east the threat of missiles remains.</p>
<p>Russia’s war is still palpable in Kyiv, even as Putin shifts the focus of his military operation to Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region. And there is a militaristic element to nearly every aspect of life now.<br></p>
<br>

<br>
<p>The scorched hulks of Russian tanks dot the E-40 highway heading to Kyiv, providing surreal selfie backdrops for returning residents. Many of the checkpoints that marked the city’s intersections have been dismantled, but the cement blocks and anti-tank metal “hedgehogs” still sit aside the road, ready to be moved back into place at a moment’s notice. Government offices, strategic buildings, and cultural landmarks are littered with barricades and mounds of sandbags.</p>
<p>Most lights go out after sundown, and there’s a heavy troop presence on the streets after curfew. On Tuesday evening, the air raid siren sounded across Kyiv’s city center, sending a shopkeeper on a smoke break and two friends into a nearby basement. There were no reports of missile strikes in the area; local authorities reported that air defense systems intercepted a missile aimed at Kyiv. Elsewhere, however, Russian missiles rained down, striking power substations in western Lviv and critical infrastructure across the country in what appeared to be one of the biggest missile bombardments in the past few weeks.</p>
<p>“They can come back at any moment,” Helena, a 34-year-old PR consultant told POLITICO as she sipped coffee on a park bench, referring to Russian soldiers who stormed into the area in February on tanks and dropped in by helicopters. “Putin wants to destroy us and he’s not finished.”<br></p>
<br>

<br>
<p>And yet, some shops and cafes have reopened. Central Khreshchatyk Street, Kyiv’s main artery, hums with traffic. And after several dry weeks, bars are now serving alcohol to war-weary customers. “We will drink to relax and we will to his death,” a wine shop employee serving a line of six people said about Putin, making a lewd gesture with her thumb and index finger.</p>
<p>Over the past week, 32 diplomatic missions have returned to work in the capital, <a href="https://mediacenter.org.ua/32-diplomatic-missions-returned-to-kyiv-the-national-guard-of-ukraine-has-revised-the-scheme-of-protection-of-such-facilities/" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;<u>according</u>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://mediacenter.org.ua/32-diplomatic-missions-returned-to-kyiv-the-national-guard-of-ukraine-has-revised-the-scheme-of-protection-of-such-facilities/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd23120005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd23120006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><u>according</u></a> to the Ukrainian National Guard commander overseeing their protection. The U.S. Embassy is not yet one of them, but its charge d'affaires said Monday on her first visit to the country since the Russian invasion began that the mission could reopen by the end of May, if security conditions allow.</p>
<p>“We listen to the security professionals, and when they tell us we can go back we will go back,” Kristina Kvien told reporters in Lviv.</p>
<p>Despite the renewed activity in the city, the war is never far away. On central Independence Square on Tuesday afternoon, a crowd gathered to plead for international help to evacuate the hundreds of Ukrainian troops still holding onto the last bastion of Ukrainian-controlled territory in southeastern Mariupol, the Azovstal iron and steel factory.</p>
<p>There, Ukrainian troops from the 36th Separate Marine Brigade and the Azov Regiment, a unit of the country’s National Guard, have fought tooth and nail to keep Russian forces from taking the plant and killing the hundreds of civilians hunkered down inside its maze of tunnels and bunkers. The rest of Mariupol is in ruins.<br></p>
<br>

<br>
<p>After weeks of difficult negotiations, Russia finally agreed to release some of the trapped civilians. Their safe evacuation to the nearby city of Zaporizhzhia was confirmed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Osnat Lubrani, the United Nations’ resident coordinator and humanitarian coordinator, who accompanied some of them to safety.</p>
<p>“I’m relieved to confirm that the safe passage operation from Mariupol has been successful,” she <a href="https://twitter.com/OsnatLubrani/status/1521472329301303297" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;<u>tweeted</u>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/OsnatLubrani/status/1521472329301303297&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd23120007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd23120008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><u>tweeted</u></a> Tuesday. “The people I traveled with told me heartbreaking stories of the hell they went through. I’m thinking about the people who remain trapped. We will do all we can to assist them.”</p>
<p>Zelensksyy said in a late-night address that 156 people arrived in Zaporizhzhia. “Women and children. They have been in shelters for more than two months. Just imagine! For example, a child is six months old, two of which are underground, fleeing bombs and shelling,” he said. “Finally, these people are completely safe. They will get help.”<br></p>

<br>
<p>Meanwhile, Ukrainian fighters inside the plant reported a new wave of Russian bombs and said ground forces were attempting to storm them.</p>
<p>“Enemy naval artillery and barrel artillery worked all night on the territory of the Azovstal plant. Heavy aircraft bombs were dropped,” Sviatoslav Palamar, deputy commander of the Azov Regiment unit inside Azovstal said in a desperate video published on the group’s Telegram channel and circulated by Ukrainian media. Two civilian women were killed in the attack, he said.<br></p>

<br>
<p>At the Independence Square demonstration, Iryna Yehorchenko joined a group of family members and friends of the trapped Ukrainians in trying to rally support for an emergency evacuation. She told POLITICO that her 22-year-old son Artem is among the trapped Azov Regiment troops. The last time she heard from him was April 10. He wrote her over a messenger app to say that the group was running low on food and water and that medical supplies, including antibiotics needed to treat several seriously wounded people, were in limited supply.</p>
<p>“He told me they had now electricity sometimes and were living in the dark,” Yehorchenko said.</p>
<p>Oleg Yehorchenko, Artem’s uncle, told POLITICO he would like to see an evacuation like the one that Ukraine’s special forces pulled off in Afghanistan in September. Then, as the Taliban tightened its grip on Kabul and the U.S. and other countries scrambled to pull people out, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/24/world/middleeast/ukraine-taliban-rescue-afghanistan.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;<u>Ukrainians managed to airlift 96 Afghans</u>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/24/world/middleeast/ukraine-taliban-rescue-afghanistan.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd23120009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd2312000a&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><u>Ukrainians managed to airlift 96 Afghans</u></a> to safety.<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/24/world/middleeast/ukraine-taliban-rescue-afghanistan.html" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;<u>&nbsp;</u>&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/24/world/middleeast/ukraine-taliban-rescue-afghanistan.html&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd2312000b&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd2312000c&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}"><u>&nbsp;</u></a></p>
<p>The only other option, the uncle said, was a daring humanitarian rescue orchestrated by a third country, possibly the U.S. But he wasn’t hopeful.</p>
<p>“They’re afraid to fly in there because it could start World War III,” he said. “But [the troops] are very close to dying and they will die soon if nobody helps them.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>OTTAWA, Ont. — Whenever Americans debate abortion rights, Canada's Campaign Life Coalition fires up its fundraising machine to activate thousands of its members who will open their wallets at a moment's notice.</p>
<p>When POLITICO published on Monday evening a draft U.S. Supreme Court opinion that would overturn the landmark <i>Roe v. Wade</i> decision that guarantees abortion rights to American people, the socially conservative advocacy group didn't waste the moment.</p>
<p>"It's very fortuitous timing for us," said youth coordinator Josie Luetke, as she rhymed off the political races in which CLC is now directing its considerable resources — the federal Conservative leadership contest, a June election in Ontario and even city elections in the same province this fall.</p>
<p>News that <i>Roe v. Wade</i> is poised to be overturned reverberated north of the border where abortion is legal, though routinely used as a wedge issue in political campaigns.</p>
<p>The CLC fundraising powerhouse is doing everything it can to support Leslyn Lewis in the Conservative leadership race, for example. The Ontario MP is the only candidate who meets the group's rigid test of moral purity.</p>
<p>"If candidates want our support, they have to be 100 percent pro-life," said Luetke.</p>
<p>No vote goes unnoticed.</p>
<p>In 2020, Lewis finished third in the party’s leadership race, scooping up social conservative support and building a powerful core of supporters.</p>
<p>"I certainly expect the draft ruling will serve as a motivator for pro-lifers here," Luetke said.</p>
<p>Social conservatives are looking toward May 12, the date of the annual March for Life rally, which typically draws thousands to Parliament Hill.</p>
<p>Lewis has only an outside shot of winning the race, but her anti-abortion position gives her sway over a contingent of the party that is likely to grow in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court draft opinion.</p>
<p>Abortion was decriminalized in Canada in 1988, when the Supreme Court struck down a 1969 law that legalized only certain abortions.</p>
<p>Former<b> </b>Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's government attempted without success to craft a new law in response to that ruling. Conservative MPs occasionally still<b> </b>use private members’ bills to force the debate onto Parliament's agenda. But no federal government has successfully passed legislation that limits abortion services.</p>
<p>Progressive parties like the Liberals and New Democratic Party consistently pledge to maintain that status quo, while expanding access to safe abortion services.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s response to POLITICO’s reporting was unequivocal. "The right to choose is a woman’s right and a woman’s right alone," <a href="https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau/status/1521535603057307655" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3272-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff7cad0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1651630468207,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-2ca1-db91-affd-fdb9430a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1651630468207,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-2ca1-db91-affd-fdb9430a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau/status/1521535603057307655&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-8cd8-dd36-a38c-cfdce74a0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;he tweeted&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-8cd8-dd36-a38c-cfdce74a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">he tweeted</a>. "Every woman in Canada has a right to a safe and legal abortion. We’ll never back down from protecting and promoting women’s rights in Canada and around the world."</p>
<p>For conservatives, the issue is far more complicated. Abortion rights are a perennial wedge issue in Canadian elections. Whenever a Conservative candidate opens the door to limiting or criminalizing the procedures, progressives launch attack ads.</p>
<p>On last year's federal campaign trail, it took just four days for the Liberals to raise the specter of an anti-abortion Conservative government.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the federal Conservatives under interim leader Candice Bergen took no chances in the wake of POLITICO's reporting.</p>
<p>The Globe and Mail and Toronto Star both reported on an early morning memo she circulated to caucus with instructions not to comment on the scoop.</p>
<p>But later in the day, Conservatives in the House of Commons refused to support a Bloc Québécois motion to "reiterate that a woman's body belongs to her and her alone and recognize her freedom of choice on abortion for any reason."</p>
<p>Elements of the Conservative Party's social conservative wing, fired up by the CLC's rhetoric on moral issues, want more than just the bare minimum. They're not afraid to point out that elected Conservatives will only enjoy their support if they vocally join the cause.</p>
<p>Former Prime Minister Stephen Harper managed to keep his Conservative Party united even as he consistently pledged not to reopen the abortion debate, but both of his successors as party leader struggled to manage competing interests in the ranks.</p>
<p>Andrew Scheer and Erin O'Toole were both turfed after a single election. O'Toole was dismissed by critics within his own party as a closet Liberal. He was ousted by his caucus this February, in part because he was abandoned by social conservatives.</p>
<p>In the wake of the draft opinion south of the border, the six candidates running to succeed O'Toole are scrambling to clarify where they stand on abortion.</p>
<p>The CLC had already declared the frontrunner, Pierre Poilievre, as "not supportable" based on his voting record in the House. He was once a reliable vote in their corner, but more recently moderated his stance. In 2012, Poilievre voted for a motion that would have studied the definition of a human being. He also supported a 2010 private member's bill that would have created a criminal offense for anyone who coerces a person to have an abortion.</p>
<p>But in 2020, when Poilievre was considering a leadership run, he committed to the same policy as Harper. His campaign reiterated that commitment in a statement sent to POLITICO.</p>
<p>Patrick Brown, the mayor of the Toronto suburb of Brampton and a former MP who's also running for leader, fired off a pledge early Tuesday to "always support the right of a woman's decision on her reproductive health. Full stop."</p>
<p>He also committed to "encourage other options," such as adoption, which enraged critics on social media who accused him of pandering to anti-abortion party members.</p>
<p>By mid-afternoon, fellow candidate Jean Charest <a href="https://twitter.com/JeanCharest_/status/1521573000289689600" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;cms.site.owner&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014b-3272-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff7cad0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff4161000e&quot;},&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1651631138628,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-2ca1-db91-affd-fdb9430a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1651631138628,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-2ca1-db91-affd-fdb9430a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000014b-324d-d4f3-a3cb-f3ff415b0002&quot;},&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;originalTemplate&quot;:false,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/JeanCharest_/status/1521573000289689600&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-8ce3-d3ee-a392-9dfb20840001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;tweeted a statement&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-8ce3-d3ee-a392-9dfb20840000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">tweeted a statement</a>. "I am pro-choice. A government under my leadership will not support legislation restricting reproductive rights," he said. "While I respect the democratic rights of MPs to bring forward private members' bills on matters of conscience, I will not vote to support them."</p>
<p>Lewis is unswayed. In a statement, Lewis pledged to ban sex-selective abortions, increase funding for "pregnancy crisis centres" and cut off federal funding for reproductive health overseas. Her <a href="https://www.campaignlifecoalition.com/leslyn-lewis-record" target="_blank" link-data="{&quot;linkText&quot;:&quot;record on CLC's website&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.campaignlifecoalition.com/leslyn-lewis-record&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd23150000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-954c-d254-a3d7-9ffd23150001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}">record on CLC's website</a> indicates she personally opposes all abortions.</p>
<p>CLC hoped to fill the party's leadership ballot with like-minded candidates. Luetke said the organization encouraged members to donate to the campaign of Joseph Bourgault, who claimed to have raised enough to cover the party's C$300,000 entry fee and compliance deposit. The party ruled that he did not meet the requirements for candidacy.</p>
<p>The party ruled neither candidate met the requirements for candidacy.</p>
<p>Bourgault's campaign appeared to have scored a massive boost in its final days. A week before the April 29 application deadline, he said he was still short C$175,000. Within a week, he reported to supporters that the campaign had topped C$400,000.</p>
<p>Luetke wouldn't comment on exactly how much CLC's efforts contributed to that haul. But her group has a track record of making a dent in leadership races.</p>
<p>In 2020, CLC claimed to have signed up 26,000 members for Lewis and another candidate, Derek Sloan. That was more than double their sign-ups three years earlier when their preferred candidates, Brad Trost and Pierre Lemieux, finished fourth and seventh.</p>
<p>Luetke said POLITICO's bombshell reignited the abortion debate north of the border.</p>
<p>"Sometimes it's just a little bit easier mentally just to disconnect from the whole issue," she says. "Victories like this one are a reason to get involved once again."</p>]]></content:encoded>
